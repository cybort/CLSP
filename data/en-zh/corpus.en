anarchism is political philosophy that advocates self governed societies based on voluntary institutions these are often described as stateless societies although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non hierarchical or free associations anarchism holds the state to be undesirable unnecessary and harmful while anti statism is central anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations anarchism is usually considered far left ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti authoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics anarchism does not offer fixed body of doctrine from single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as philosophy many types and traditions of anarchism exist not all of which are mutually exclusive anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications etymology and terminology the word anarchism is composed from the word anarchy and the suffix ism themselves derived respectively from the greek anarchy from anarchos meaning one without rulers from the privative prefix ἀν an without and archos leader ruler cf archon or arkhē authority sovereignty realm magistracy and the suffix or ismos isma from the verbal infinitive suffix ίζειν izein the first known use of this word was in various factions within the french revolution labelled opponents as anarchists as robespierre did the hébertists although few shared many views of later anarchists there would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre joseph proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid nineteenth century since the and beginning in france the term libertarianism has often been used as synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the in the united states its use as synonym is still common outside the united states on the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism history origins woodcut from diggers document by william everard the earliest anarchist themes can be found in the th century bc among the works of taoist philosopher laozi and in later centuries by zhuangzi and bao jingyan zhuangzi philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist zhuangzi wrote petty thief is put in jail great brigand becomes ruler of nation diogenes of sinope and the cynics as well as their contemporary zeno of citium the founder of stoicism also introduced similar topics jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the christian anarchist tradition georges lechartier wrote the true founder of anarchy was jesus christ and the first anarchist society was that of the apostles in early islamic history some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the islamic civil war over the caliphate where the kharijites insisted that the imamate is right for each individual within the islamic society the french renaissance political philosopher étienne de la boétie wrote in his most famous work the discourse on voluntary servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent the radical protestant christian gerrard winstanley and his group the diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the th century in england the term anarchist first entered the english language in during the english civil war as term of abuse used by royalists against their roundhead opponents by the time of the french revolution some such as the enragés began to use the term positively in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power seeing revolutionary government as oxymoronic by the turn of the th century the english word anarchism had lost its initial negative connotation modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment particularly jean jacques rousseau arguments for the moral centrality of freedom as part of the political turmoil of the in the wake of the french revolution william godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought godwin was according to peter kropotkin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work while godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early edmund burke william godwin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism he argued in political justice that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power rather he advocated for its replacement through process of peaceful evolution his aversion to the imposition of rules based society led him to denounce as manifestation of the people mental enslavement the foundations of law property rights and even the institution of marriage he considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at mutually beneficial method of social organisation in each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement the french pierre joseph proudhon is regarded as the first self proclaimed anarchist label he adopted in his groundbreaking work what is property published in it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory he developed the theory of spontaneous order in society where organisation emerges without central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests his famous quote on the matter is liberty is the mother not the daughter of order in what is property proudhon answers with the famous accusation property is theft in this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propriété where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish he contrasted this with what he called possession or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use later however proudhon added that property is liberty and argued that it was bulwark against state power his opposition to the state organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time the anarcho communist joseph déjacque was the first person to describe himself as libertarian unlike pierre joseph proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature in in germany the post hegelian philosopher max stirner published the book the ego and its own which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism french anarchists active in the revolution included anselme bellegarrigue ernest coeurderoy joseph déjacque and pierre joseph proudhon first international and the paris commune anarchist mikhail bakunin opposed the marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat in favour of universal rebellion and allied himself with the federalists in the first international before his expulsion by the marxists in europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of during which ten countries had experienced brief or long term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists anarchists liberals and nationalists to prevent further revolt in spain ramón de la sagra established the anarchist journal el porvenir in la coruña in which was inspired by proudhon ideas the catalan politician francesc pi margall became the principal translator of proudhon works into spanish and later briefly became president of spain in while being the leader of the democratic republican federal party according to george woodcock these translations were to have profound and lasting effect on the development of spanish anarchism after but before that time proudhonian ideas as interpreted by pi already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early according to the encyclopædia britannica during the spanish revolution of pi margall attempted to establish decentralised or cantonalist political system on proudhonian lines in the international workingmen association sometimes called the first international united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon blanquists philadelphes english trade unionists socialists and social democrats due to its links to active workers movements the international became significant organisation karl marx became leading figure in the international and member of its general council proudhon followers the mutualists opposed marx state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings woodcock also reports that the american individualist anarchists lysander spooner and william greene had been members of the first international in following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom lpf russian revolutionary mikhail bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the first international which had decided not to get involved with the lpf they allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the international who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the of property at first the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in more revolutionary socialist direction subsequently the international became polarised into two camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads mikhail bakunin characterised marx ideas as centralist and predicted that if marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against anarchist historian george woodcock reports that the annual congress of the international had not taken place in owing to the outbreak of the paris commune and in the general council called only special conference in london one delegate was able to attend from spain and none from italy while technical excuse that they had split away from the fédération romande was used to avoid inviting bakunin swiss supporters thus only tiny minority of anarchists was present and the general council resolutions passed almost unanimously most of them were clearly directed against bakunin and his followers in the conflict climaxed with final split between the two groups at the hague congress where bakunin and james guillaume were expelled from the international and its headquarters were transferred to new york in response the federalist sections formed their own international at the st imier congress adopting revolutionary anarchist programme the paris commune was government that briefly ruled paris from march more formally from march to may the commune was the result of an uprising in paris after france was defeated in the franco prussian war anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the paris commune they included louise michel the reclus brothers and eugene varlin the latter murdered in the repression afterwards as for the reforms initiated by the commune such as the re opening of workplaces as co operatives anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised moreover the commune ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of proudhon on french radical ideas indeed the commune vision of communal france based on federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes bakunin and proudhon ideas proudhon like bakunin had argued in favour of the implementation of the binding mandate in and for federation of communes thus both economically and politically the paris commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas george woodcock states organised labour the anti authoritarian sections of the first international were the precursors of the anarcho syndicalists seeking to replace the privilege and authority of the state with the free and spontaneous organization of labour in the federation of organized trades and labor unions fotlu of the united states and canada unanimously set may as the date by which the eight hour work day would become standard sympathetic engraving by walter crane of the executed anarchists of chicago after the haymarket affair the haymarket affair is generally considered the most significant event for the origin of international may day observances in response unions across the united states prepared general strike in support of the event on may in chicago fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd the next day may anarchists staged rally at chicago haymarket square bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally killing an officer in the ensuing panic police opened fire on the crowd and each other seven police officers and at least four workers were killed eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer the men became international political celebrities among the labour movement four of the men were executed and fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution the incident became known as the haymarket affair and was setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day in second attempt this time international in scope to organise for the eight hour day was made the event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as result of the haymarket affair although it had initially been conceived as once off event by the following year the celebration of international workers day on may day had become firmly established as an international worker holiday in the international anarchist congress of amsterdam gathered delegates from different countries among which were important figures of the anarchist movement including errico malatesta pierre monatte luigi fabbri benoît broutchoux emma goldman rudolf rocker and christiaan cornelissen various themes were treated during the congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement popular education issues the general strike or antimilitarism central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism or trade unionism malatesta and monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of social revolution while malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient he thought that the trade union movement was reformist and even conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and anti worker the phenomenon of professional union officials malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it the spanish workers federation in was the first major anarcho syndicalist movement anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in spain the most successful was the confederación nacional del trabajo national confederation of labour cnt founded in before the the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics attracting million members at one point and playing major role in the spanish civil war the cnt was affiliated with the international workers association federation of anarcho syndicalist trade unions founded in with delegates representing two million workers from countries in europe and latin america in latin america in particular the anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout south and central america and until the early most of the trade unions in mexico brazil peru chile and argentina were anarcho syndicalist in general outlook the prestige of the spanish as revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to great extent responsible for this situation the largest and most militant of these organisations was the federación obrera regional argentina it grew quickly to membership of nearly quarter of million which dwarfed the rival unions propaganda of the deed and illegalism italian american anarchist luigi galleani his followers known as galleanists carried out series of bombings and assassination attempts from to in what they saw as attacks on tyrants and enemies of the people some anarchists such as johann most advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter revolutionaries because we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda scholars such as beverly gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder but targeted killings of members of the ruling class at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population such as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed however most himself once boasted that the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents therefore massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion most is best known for pamphlet published in the science of revolutionary warfare how to manual on the subject of making explosives based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in new jersey by the people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan propaganda of the deed to refer to individual bombings regicides and tyrannicides from onwards the russian counterparts of these anti syndicalist anarchist communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations illegalism as practice emerged and within it the acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins propaganda by the deed and the anarchist burglars individual reappropriation expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society moreover they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt france bonnot gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism however as soon as important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts peter kropotkin thus wrote that year in le révolté that structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with few kilos of dynamite variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action for example through the trade union movement the anarcho syndicalist fernand pelloutier argued in for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without the individual dynamiter state repression including the infamous french lois scélérates of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression in the first place may have played role in these isolated acts the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and following the suppression of the paris commune the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts numerous heads of state were assassinated between and by members of the anarchist movement including tsar alexander ii of russia president sadi carnot of france empress elisabeth of austria king umberto of italy president william mckinley of the united states king carlos of portugal and king george of greece mckinley assassin leon czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist emma goldman russian revolution and other uprisings of the nestor makhno with members of the anarchist revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions and were initially enthusiastic about the bolshevik revolution however following political falling out with the bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left wing opposition the conflict culminated in the kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed anarchists in central russia were either imprisoned driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks the anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine there in the free territory they fought in the civil war against the whites grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the october revolution and then the bolsheviks as part of the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine led by nestor makhno who established an anarchist society in the region for number of months expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman were among those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising before they left russia both wrote accounts of their experiences in russia criticising the amount of control the bolsheviks exercised for them bakunin predictions about the consequences of marxist rule that the rulers of the new socialist marxist state would become new elite had proved all too true the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the united states for example members of the major syndicalist movements of the cgt and iww left the organisations and joined the communist international the revolutionary wave of saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism in the german uprising known as the german revolution of which established the bavarian soviet republic the anarchists gustav landauer silvio gesell and erich mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures in the italian events known as the biennio rosso the anarcho syndicalist trade union unione sindacale italiana grew to members and the influence of the italian anarchist union members plus umanita nova its daily paper grew accordingly anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces in the mexican revolution the mexican liberal party was established and during the early it led series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in baja california with the leadership of anarcho communist ricardo flores magón in paris the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles which included nestor makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism their manifesto called the organisational platform of the general union of anarchists draft was supported platformist groups active today include the workers solidarity movement in ireland and the north eastern federation of anarchist communists of north america synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives in the this form found as its main proponents volin and sebastien faure it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations conflicts with european fascist regimes in the and the rise of fascism in europe transformed anarchism conflict with the state italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists italian anarchists played key role in the anti fascist organisation arditi del popolo which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism such as repelling blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of parma in august the veteran italian anarchist luigi fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism describing it as the preventive counter revolution in france where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the february riots anarchists divided over united front policy anarchists in france and italy were active in the resistance during world war ii in germany the anarchist erich mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of february within few hours after the reichstag fire in berlin joseph goebbels the nazi propaganda minister labelled him as one of those jewish subversives over the next seventeen months he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at sonnenburg brandenburg and finally oranienburg on february mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp at oranienburg when finally on the night of july mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards his battered corpse found hanging in latrine the next morning spanish revolution in spain the national anarcho syndicalist trade union confederación nacional del trabajo initially refused to join popular front electoral alliance and abstention by cnt supporters led to right wing election victory but in the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power months later conservative members of the military with the support of minority extreme right parties responded with an attempted coup causing the spanish civil war in response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land but even before the fascist victory in the anarchists were losing ground in bitter struggle with the stalinists who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the republican cause from the soviet union according to noam chomsky the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the spanish anarchists not just in catalonia the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere the communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the republic and were very much opposed to the anarchists partially because stalin still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with western countries against hitler that of course failed and stalin withdrew the support to the republic they even withdrew the spanish gold reserves the events known as the spanish revolution was workers social revolution that began during the outbreak of the spanish civil war in and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years primarily catalonia aragon andalusia and parts of the levante much of spain economy was put under worker control in anarchist strongholds like catalonia the figure was as high as but lower in areas with heavy communist party of spain influence as the soviet allied party actively resisted attempts at enactment factories were run through worker committees agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes anarchist historian sam dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the spanish revolution which he claimed came closer to realising the ideal of the free stateless society on vast scale than any other revolution in history spanish communist party led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident marxists and anarchists the prominent italian anarchist camillo berneri who volunteered to fight against franco was killed instead in spain by gunmen associated with the spanish communist party the city of madrid was turned over to the francoist forces by the last non francoist mayor of the city the anarchist melchor rodríguez garcía post war years anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of italy and france the mexican anarchist federation was established in after the anarchist federation of the centre united with the anarchist federation of the federal district in the early the antifascist international solidarity and the federation of anarchist groups of cuba merged into the large national organisation asociación libertaria de cuba cuban libertarian association from to the bulgarian anarchist communist federation reemerged as part of factory and workplace committee movement but was repressed by the new communist regime in in france the fédération anarchiste and the trade union confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist federazione anarchica italiana was founded in italy korean anarchists formed the league of free social constructors in september and in the japanese anarchist federation was founded an international anarchist congress with delegates from across europe was held in paris in may after world war ii an appeal in the fraye arbeter shtime detailing the plight of german anarchists and called for americans to support them by february the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in germany was large scale operation the federation of libertarian socialists was founded in germany in and rudolf rocker wrote for its organ die freie gesellschaft which survived until in the uruguayan anarchist federation was founded in the anarcho communist federation of argentina renamed itself as the argentine libertarian federation the syndicalist workers federation was syndicalist group in active in post war britain and one of solidarity federation earliest predecessors it was formed in by members of the dissolved anarchist federation of britain unlike the afb which was influenced by anarcho syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself the swf decided to pursue more definitely syndicalist worker centred strategy from the outset anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time such as albert camus herbert read paul goodman dwight macdonald allen ginsberg george woodcock leopold kohr julian beck john cage and the french surrealist group led by andré breton which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the fédération anarchiste anarcho pacifism became influential in the anti nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the english anarchist member of campaign for nuclear disarmament alex comfort or the similar activism of the american catholic anarcho pacifists ammon hennacy and dorothy day anarcho pacifism became basis for critique of militarism on both sides of the cold war the resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in robert graham anarchism documentary history of libertarian ideas volume two the emergence of the new anarchism contemporary anarchism squat near parc güell overlooking barcelona squatting was prominent part of the emergence of renewed anarchist movement from the counterculture of the and on the roof occupy and resist surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the and anarchism was influential in the counterculture of the and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts in in carrara italy the international of anarchist federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in by the three existing european federations of france the fédération anarchiste the federazione anarchica italiana of italy and the iberian anarchist federation as well as the bulgarian federation in french exile in the united kingdom in the this was associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols the housing and employment crisis in most of western europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of barcelona spain in denmark squatters occupied disused military base and declared the freetown christiania an autonomous haven in central copenhagen since the revival of anarchism in the mid th century number of new movements and schools of thought emerged although feminist tendencies have always been part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha feminism they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the anarchist anthropologist david graeber and anarchist historian andrej grubacic have posited rupture between generations of anarchism with those who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits of the th century contrasted with the younger activists who are much more informed among other elements by indigenous feminist ecological and cultural critical ideas and who by the turn of the st century formed by far the majority of anarchists around the turn of the st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti war anti capitalist and anti globalisation movements anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the world trade organization wto group of eight and the world economic forum some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with police these actions were precipitated by ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet significant event of this period was the confrontations at wto conference in seattle in according to anarchist scholar simon critchley contemporary anarchism can be seen as powerful critique of the pseudo libertarianism of contemporary neo liberalism one might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility whether sexual ecological or socio economic it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the west ravages the rest it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality impoverishment and that is so palpable locally and globally international anarchist federations in existence include the international of anarchist federations the international workers association and international libertarian solidarity the largest organised anarchist movement today is in spain in the form of the confederación general del trabajo cgt and the cnt cgt membership was estimated at around for anarchist schools of thought portrait of philosopher pierre joseph proudhon by gustave courbet proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist mutualism and influenced many future individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions individualist anarchism and social anarchism which have some different origins values and evolution the individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty opposition to state or social control over the individual while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil recognising equality of entitlement in chronological and theoretical sense there are classical those created throughout the th century and post classical anarchist schools those created since the mid th century and after beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of minimal state as unfortunate and usually temporary necessary evil but argue that citizens do not have moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives call for toleration first adopted by fernando tarrida del mármol in in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time in abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms collectivist communist mutualist and individualist anarchism it sought to emphasise the anti authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought classical anarchist schools of thought mutualism mutualism began in th century english and french labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with pierre joseph proudhon in france and others in the united states proudhon proposed spontaneous order whereby organisation emerges without central authority positive anarchy where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes and where business transactions alone produce the social order proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance for this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self governance proudhon was heavily involved in french parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating state protected charters for worker owned cooperatives promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform according to the american mutualist william batchelder greene each worker in the mutualist system would receive just and exact pay for his work services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost without profit or discount mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism blackwell encyclopaedia of political thought blackwell publishing proudhon first characterised his goal as third form of society the synthesis of communism and property social anarchism social anarchism calls for system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations without any government authority or coercion it is the largest school of thought in anarchism social anarchism rejects private property seeing it as source of social inequality while retaining respect for personal property and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid collectivist anarchism collectivist anarchism also referred to as revolutionary socialism or form of such is revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin and johann most collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production instead advocating that ownership be collectivised this was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with small cohesive group through acts of violence or propaganda by the deed which would inspire the workers as whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production however was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho communism this position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively upholding the wages system collectivist anarchism arose with marxism but opposed the marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of collectivist stateless society anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour some held out the possibility of post revolutionary transition to communist system of distribution according to need anarcho communism anarchist communism also known as anarcho communism libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism is theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state markets money private property while retaining respect for personal property and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need russian theorist peter kropotkin who was influential in the development of anarchist communism some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism believing anarcho communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom most anarcho communists view anarcho communism as way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society anarcho communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the french revolution but was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international the theoretical work of peter kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro and insurrectionary anti sections to date the best known examples of an anarchist communist society established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon are the anarchist territories during the spanish revolution and the free territory during the russian revolution through the efforts and influence of the spanish anarchists during the spanish revolution within the spanish civil war starting in anarchist communism existed in most of aragon parts of the levante and andalusia as well as in the stronghold of anarchist catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war hitler mussolini spanish communist party repression backed by the ussr as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the spanish republic itself during the russian revolution anarchists such as nestor makhno worked to create and defend through the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine anarchist communism in the free territory of the ukraine from before being conquered by the bolsheviks in anarcho syndicalism may day demonstration of spanish anarcho syndicalist trade union cnt in bilbao basque country in anarcho syndicalism is branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement anarcho syndicalists view labour unions as potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with new society democratically self managed by workers the basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are workers solidarity direct action and workers self management anarcho syndicalists believe that only direct action that is action concentrated on directly attaining goal as opposed to indirect action such as electing representative to government position will allow workers to liberate themselves moreover anarcho syndicalists believe that workers organisations the organisations that struggle against the wage system which in anarcho syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of new society should be self managing they should not have bosses or business agents rather the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves rudolf rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho syndicalist movement he outlined view of the origins of the movement what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his pamphlet anarcho syndicalism the international workers association is an international anarcho syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries the spanish confederación nacional del trabajo played and still plays major role in the spanish labour movement it was also an important force in the spanish civil war individualist anarchism individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups society traditions and ideological systems individualist anarchism is not single philosophy but refers to group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict in william godwin who has often been cited as the first anarchist wrote political justice which some consider the first expression of anarchism godwin philosophical anarchist from rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw minimal state as present necessary evil that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge godwin advocated individualism proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good th century philosopher max stirner usually considered prominent early individualist anarchist sketch by friedrich engels an influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and best known proponents of individualist anarchism the german max stirner stirner the ego and its own published in is founding text of the philosophy according to stirner the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire without regard for god state or morality to stirner rights were spooks in the mind and he held that society does not exist but the individuals are its reality stirner advocated self assertion and foresaw unions of egoists non systematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will which stirner proposed as form of organisation in place of the state egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals egoism has inspired many interpretations of stirner philosophy it was re discovered and promoted by german philosophical anarchist and homosexual activist john henry mackay josiah warren is widely regarded as the first american anarchist and the four page weekly paper he edited during the peaceful revolutionist was the first anarchist periodical published for american anarchist historian eunice minette schuster it is apparent that proudhonian anarchism was to be found in the united states at least as early as and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the individualist anarchism of josiah warren and stephen pearl andrews william greene presented this proudhonian mutualism in its purest and most systematic form henry david thoreau was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the united states and europe thoreau was an american author poet naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor historian philosopher and leading he is best known for his books walden reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay civil disobedience an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state later benjamin tucker fused stirner egoism with the economics of warren and proudhon in his eclectic influential publication liberty from these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals free love and birth control advocates see anarchism and issues related to love and sex individualist naturists nudists see anarcho naturism freethought and anti clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation see european individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in france these authors and activists included oscar wilde emile armand han ryner henri zisly renzo novatore miguel gimenez igualada adolf brand and lev chernyi among others post classical schools of thought lawrence jarach left and john zerzan right two prominent contemporary anarchist authors zerzan is known as prominent voice within anarcho primitivism while jarach is noted advocate of post left anarchy anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and syncretic combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches green anarchism or eco anarchism is school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues with an important precedent in anarcho naturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho primitivism and social ecology writing from green anarchist perspective john zerzan attributes the ills of today social degradation to technology and the birth of agricultural civilization while layla abdelrahim argues that the shift in human consciousness was also shift in human subsistence strategies whereby some human animals reinvented their narrative to center murder and predation and thereby violence thus according to her civilization was the result of the human development of technologies and grammar for predatory economics language and literacy she claims are some of these technologies anarcha feminism also called anarchist feminism and anarcho feminism combines anarchism with feminism it generally views patriarchy as manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association anarcha feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle and the anarchist struggle against the state in essence the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa susan brown claims that as anarchism is political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power it is inherently feminist anarcha feminism began with the late th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre anarcho pacifism is tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change see non violence it developed mostly in the netherlands britain and the united states before and during the second world war christian anarchism is movement in political theology that combines anarchism and christianity its main proponents included leo tolstoy dorothy day ammon hennacy and jacques ellul platformism is tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of dielo truda organisational platform of the general union of anarchists draft the document was based on the experiences of russian anarchists in the october revolution which led eventually to the victory of the bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups the platform attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement failures during the russian revolution synthesis anarchism is form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives in the this form found as its main proponents the anarcho communists voline and sébastien faure it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations post left anarchy is recent current in anarchist thought that promotes critique of anarchism relationship to traditional left wing politics some post leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting critique of organisations and morality influenced by the work of max stirner and by the marxist situationist international post left anarchy is marked by focus on social insurrection and rejection of leftist social organisation insurrectionary anarchism is revolutionary theory practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises insurrection within anarchist practice it is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on political programme and periodic congresses instead insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack permanent class conflict and refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies post anarchism is theoretical move towards synthesis of classical anarchist theory and thought drawing from diverse ideas including post modernism autonomist marxism post left anarchy situationist international and postcolonialism left wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support strongly anti corporatist anti hierarchical pro labour positions and anti capitalism in economics and anti imperialism in foreign policy anarcho capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of self ownership in free market anarcho capitalism developed from radical anti state libertarianism and individualist anarchism drawing from austrian school economics study of law and economics and public choice theory there is strong current within anarchism which believes that anarcho capitalism cannot be considered part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as incompatible with capitalist forms internal issues and debates consistent with anarchist values is controversial subject among anarchists anarchism is philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought as such disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed similarly anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as marxism communism collectivism syndicalism trade unionism and capitalism anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened self interest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines phenomena such as civilisation technology within anarcho primitivism and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others on tactical level while propaganda of the deed was tactic used by anarchists in the th century the nihilist movement some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence counter economics and anti state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society about the scope of an anarchist society some anarchists advocate global one while others do so by local ones the diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory topics of interest intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory free love french individualist anarchist emile armand who propounded the virtues of free love in the parisian anarchist milieu of the early th century an important current within anarchism is free love free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to josiah warren and to experimental communities viewed sexual freedom as clear direct expression of an individual sovereignty free love particularly stressed women rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women for example marriage laws and anti birth control measures the most important american free love journal was lucifer the lightbearer edited by moses harman and lois waisbrooker but also there existed ezra heywood and angela heywood the word free society as the firebrand as free society was major anarchist newspaper in the united states at the end of the th and beginning of the th centuries the publication advocated free love and women rights and critiqued comstockery censorship of sexual information also lazarus was an important american individualist anarchist who promoted free love in new york city greenwich village bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self realisation and pleasure for women and also men in the here and now they encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality and the openly bisexual radical edna st vincent millay and the lesbian anarchist margaret anderson were prominent among them discussion groups organised by the villagers were frequented by emma goldman among others magnus hirschfeld noted in that goldman has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights and especially for those deprived of their rights thus it came about that she was the first and only woman indeed the first and only american to take up the defence of homosexual love before the general public in fact before goldman heterosexual anarchist robert reitzel spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the in his detroit based german language journal der arme teufel english the poor devil in argentina anarcha feminist virginia bolten published the newspaper called english the woman voice which was published nine times in rosario between january and january and was revived briefly in in europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was emile armand he proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults he was also consistent proponent of polyamory in germany the stirnerists adolf brand and john henry mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality mujeres libres was an anarchist women organisation in spain that aimed to empower working class women it was founded in by lucía sánchez saornil mercedes comaposada and amparo poch gascón and had approximately members the organisation was based on the idea of double struggle for women liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel in order to gain mutual support they created networks of women anarchists lucía sánchez saornil was main founder of the spanish anarcha feminist federation mujeres libres who was open about her lesbianism she was published in variety of literary journals where working under male pen name she was able to explore lesbian themes at time when homosexuality was criminalised and subject to censorship and punishment more recently the british anarcho pacifist alex comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual the joy of sex the issue of free love has dedicated treatment in the work of french anarcho hedonist philosopher michel onfray in such works as théorie du corps amoureux pour une érotique solaire and invention du plaisir fragments cyréaniques libertarian education and freethought francesc ferrer guàrdia catalan anarchist pedagogue and free thinker for english anarchist william godwin education was the main means by which change would be achieved godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness for godwin education had to have respect for the child autonomy which precluded any form of coercion pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child own motivation and initiatives and concern about the child capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school in his political justice he criticises state sponsored schooling on account of its obvious alliance with national government early american anarchist josiah warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established max stirner wrote in long essay on education called the false principle of our education in it stirner names his educational principle personalist explaining that self understanding consists in hourly self creation education for him is to create free men sovereign characters by which he means eternal characters who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment in the united states freethought was basically anti christian anti clerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters number of contributors to liberty anarchist publication were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism the individualist anarchist george macdonald was co editor of freethought and for time the truth seeker walker was co editor of the excellent free thought free love journal lucifer the light bearer many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers reprints from freethought papers such as lucifer the light bearer freethought and the truth seeker appeared in liberty the church was viewed as common ally of the state and as repressive force in and of itself in catalan anarchist and free thinker francesc ferrer guàrdia established modern or progressive schools in barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the catholic church the schools stated goal was to educate the working class in rational secular and non coercive setting fiercely anti clerical ferrer believed in freedom in education education free from the authority of church and state murray bookchin wrote this period was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where anarchists exercised some degree of influence perhaps the best known effort in this field was francisco ferrer modern school escuela moderna project which exercised considerable influence on catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally la escuela moderna and ferrer ideas generally formed the inspiration for series of modern schools in the united states cuba south america and london the first of these was started in new york city in it also inspired the italian newspaper università popolare founded in russian christian anarchist leo tolstoy established school for peasant children on his estate tolstoy educational experiments were short lived due to harassment by the tsarist secret police tolstoy established conceptual difference between education and culture he thought that education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself education is culture under restraint culture is free education is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil and when then instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary for him without compulsion education was transformed into culture more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child led activity replaces pedagogic approaches experiments in germany led to neill founding what became summerhill school in summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice however although summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian they differ in principle from those of ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle approach in addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se the term deschooling was popularised by ivan illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self determined learning and serves the creation of consumer society instead criticisms criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms

greek classical uncial version latin ad uncial version the earliest certain ancestor of is aleph also written aleph the first letter of the phoenician alphabet which consisted entirely of consonants for that reason it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from true alphabet in turn the ancestor of aleph may have been pictogram of an ox head in proto sinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs styled as triangular head with two horns extended by bc the phoenician alphabet letter had linear form that served as the base for some later forms its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the hebrew or arabic aleph blackletter ablackletter uncial auncial another capital aanother blackletter modern roman amodern roman modern italic amodern italic modern script amodern script when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for letter to represent the glottal stop the consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel and called it by the similar name of alpha in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the th century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages including english typographic variants different glyphs of the lowercase letter during roman times there were many variant forms of the letter first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent media there was also cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces due to the perishable nature of these surfaces there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles the known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial typographic variants include double storey and single storey at the end of the roman empire th century ad several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular or anglo irish semi uncial or anglo saxon majuscule of great britain by the th century the caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press this form was derived through combining of prior forms th century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today these variants the italic and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version the italic form also called script is used in most current handwriting and consists of circle and vertical stroke this slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers the roman form is used in most printed material it consists of small loop with an arc over it both derive from the majuscule capital form in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown many fonts then made the right leg vertical in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of text from the rest set in roman type there are some other cases aside from italic type where script also called latin alpha is used in contrast with latin such as in the international phonetic alphabet use in writing systems px english in modern english orthography the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds the near open front unrounded vowel as in pad the open back unrounded vowel as in father which is closer to its original latin and greek sound the diphthong as in ace and major usually when is

cave has been dated as early as to bc the european american naming of the alabama river and state was derived from the alabama people muskogean speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river in the alabama language the word for person of alabama lineage is albaamo or variously albaama or albàamo in different dialects the plural form is albaamaha the suggestion that alabama was borrowed from the choctaw language is unlikely the word spelling varies significantly among historical sources the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of garcilaso de la vega used alibamo while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote alibamu and limamu respectively in of the term as early as the french called the tribe the alibamon with french maps identifying the river as rivière des alibamons other spellings of the name have included alibamu alabamo albama alebamon alibama alibamou alabamu allibamou sources disagree on the word meaning some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather the meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants the state has numerous place names of native american origin however there are no correspondingly similar words in the alabama language an article in the jacksonville republican proposed it meant here we rest this notion was popularized in the through the

exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens the rural dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes partially as response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid one third of the construction costs the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas they often donated land and labor as well the former mount sinai school in rural autauga county completed in it was one of the rosenwald schools built in the state beginning in the first rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african american children total of schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by in the state several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the th century as part of the great migration out of the south reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from to at the same time many rural people both white and african american migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the magic city by the birmingham was the th largest city in the united states and had more than of the state population heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy its residents were under represented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution this did not change until the late following lawsuit and court order beginning in the when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters the alabama legislature took several counter steps designed to disfranchise black voters the legislature passed and the voters ratified as these were mostly white voters state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants black citizens in mobile successfully challenged this amendment as violation of the fifteenth amendment the legislature also changed the boundaries of tuskegee to sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits the supreme court unanimously held that this racial gerrymandering violated the constitution in the alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and higher standard of living one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile between and more than people moved into the city to work for war related industries cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed manufacturing and service base despite massive population changes in the state from to the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas in addition the state legislature gerrymandered the few birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside birmingham one result was that jefferson county containing birmingham industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive proportional amount in services urban interests were consistently in the legislature study noted that because of rural domination minority of about per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature class action suit initiated on behalf of plaintiffs in lowndes county alabama challenged the state legislature lack of redistricting for congressional seats in white crook judge frank johnson ordered the state to redistrict united states supreme court cases of baker carr and reynolds sims ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties as alabama had used for its senate in for the first time since the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census this benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been for more than years other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts african americans continued to press in the and to end and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement including legal challenges in the us supreme court ruled in brown board of education that public schools had to be desegregated but alabama was slow to comply during the under governor george wallace alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama including the montgomery bus boycott freedom rides in and selma to montgomery marches these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of and voting rights act of by the congress legal segregation ended in the states in but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court according to the new york times by many of alabama african americans were living in the alabama cities particularly birmingham and montgomery in addition the rural black belt called that for its soil that stretches across the middle of the state is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly african american these counties include dallas lowndes marengo and perry despite recommendations of alabama constitutional commission the state legislature did not approve an amendment to establish home rule for counties there is very limited home rule but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to county level functions and policies this both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues alabama has made some changes since the late th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation in the an omnibus redistricting case dillard crenshaw county challenged the at large voting for representative seats of alabama jurisdictions including counties and school boards at large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in county as the majority tended to take all seats despite african americans making up significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at large jurisdictions as part of settlement of this case five alabama cities and counties including chilton county adopted system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi seat jurisdictions this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters in another form of proportional representation jurisdictions use limited voting as in conecuh county in limited voting was first tested in conecuh county together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens geography general map of alabama alabama is the thirtieth largest state in the united states with of total area of the

government is the alabama constitution which was ratified in at almost amendments and words it is by some accounts the world longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the united states constitution there has been significant movement to rewrite and modernize alabama constitution critics argue that alabama constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature leaving practically no power in local hands most counties do not have home rule any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire alabama legislature and frequently by state referendum one criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism the alabama judicial building in montgomery it houses the alabama supreme court alabama court of civil appeals and alabama court of criminal appeals alabama government is divided into three coequal branches the legislative branch is the alabama legislature bicameral assembly composed of the alabama house of representatives with members and the alabama senate with members the legislature is responsible for writing debating passing or defeating state legislation the republican party currently holds majority in both houses of the legislature the legislature has the power to override gubernatorial veto by simple majority most state legislatures require two thirds majority to override veto until the state elected state senators on geographic basis by county with one per county it had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in as result urbanized areas were grossly it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses either in reynolds sims the us supreme court implemented the principle of one man one vote ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented further the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems at that time alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting as many across the country had systems that urban areas and districts this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas for instance birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one third of the state budget but jefferson county received only th of state services in funding through the legislative delegations the alabama legislature kept control of county governments governor kay ivey is the current and second female governor of alabama she is the only republican female governor in the state history the executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws it is headed by the governor of alabama other members of executive branch include the cabinet the attorney general of alabama the alabama secretary of state the alabama state treasurer and the state auditor of alabama the current governor of the state is republican kay ivey the office of lieutenant governor is currently vacant the members of the legislature take office immediately after the november elections statewide officials such as the governor lieutenant governor attorney general and other constitutional officers take office the following january the judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases the state highest court is the supreme court of alabama alabama uses partisan elections to select judges since the judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized the current chief justice of the alabama supreme court is republican lyn stuart all sitting justices on the alabama supreme court are members of the republican party there are two intermediate appellate courts the court of civil appeals and the court of criminal appeals and four trial courts the circuit court trial court of general jurisdiction and the district probate and municipal courts some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country in some years it imposes more death sentences than does texas state which has population five times larger some of its cases have been highly controversial the supreme court has overturned convictions in death penalty cases it was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use death sentence in cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole lwop that were voted unanimously by juries this judicial authority was removed in april taxes alabama levies or percent personal income tax depending upon the amount earned and filing status taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their alabama state tax and can do so even if taking the standard deduction taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the federal insurance contributions act tax social security and medicare tax the state general sales tax rate is sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases for example the total sales tax rate in mobile is and there is an additional restaurant tax of which means that diner in mobile would pay an tax on meal sales and excise taxes in alabama account for of all state and local revenue compared with an average of about nationwide alabama is one of seven states that levy tax on food at the same rate as other goods and one of two states the other being neighboring mississippi which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low income families most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply lower tax rate alabama income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the united states alabama is the only state that levies income tax on family of four with income as low as which is barely one quarter of the federal poverty line alabama threshold is the lowest among the states and the district of columbia with income taxes the corporate income tax rate is currently the overall federal state and local tax burden in alabama ranks the state as the second least tax burdened state in the country property taxes are the lowest in the the current state constitution requires voter referendum to raise property taxes since alabama tax structure largely depends on consumer spending it is subject to high variable budget structure for example in alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as million county and local governments treemap of the popular vote by county presidential election alabama has counties each county has its own elected legislative branch usually called the county commission it also has limited executive authority in the county because of the constraints of the alabama constitution which centralizes power in the state legislature only seven counties jefferson lee mobile madison montgomery shelby and tuscaloosa in the state have limited home rule instead most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties as recommended by the alabama constitutional commission legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county united states supreme court decisions in baker carr required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population and redistricted after each census in order to implement the principle of one man one vote before that each county was represented by one state senator leading to under representation in the state senate for more urbanized populous counties the rural bias of the state legislature which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house affected politics well into the th century failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution alabama constitution has been amended more than times and almost one third of the amendments are local in nature applying to only one county or city significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state meaning that the state government holds monopoly on the sale of alcohol the alabama alcoholic beverage control board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state twenty five of the

pell city pell city politics during reconstruction following the american civil war alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope in the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans in part by suppressing the african american vote through violence fraud and intimidation after coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents process completed in provisions of the constitution provisions which disenfranchised african americans resulted in excluding many poor whites by more whites than african americans had been disenfranchised to the total effects were greater on the african american community as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law from through the the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and of certain areas as counties were the basis of election districts the result was rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three quarters of the century until series of federal court cases required redistricting in to meet equal representation alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the and during the civil rights movement when whites and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform governor george wallace the state only four term governor was controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation only after passage of the federal civil rights act of and voting rights act of did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage among other civil rights in many jurisdictions they continued to be excluded from representation by at large electoral systems which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single member districts that enable more diverse representation among county boards in the alabama legislature passed and republican governor bob riley signed resolution expressing profound regret over slavery and its lingering impact in symbolic ceremony the bill was signed in the alabama state capitol which housed congress of the confederate states of america in republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in years after nearly complete realignment of political parties who represent different visions in the st century as of december there are total of registered voters with active and the others inactive in the state elections state elections with the of african americans in the state became part of the solid south system in which the democratic party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every southern state for nearly years local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election since the mid to late th century however there has been realignment among the two major political parties and white conservatives started shifting to the republican party in alabama majority white districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal state and local office members of the nine seats on the alabama supreme court and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office until no republicans held any of the court seats in that general election the then incumbent chief justice of alabama ernest hornsby refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately votes to republican perry hooper sr hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court this ultimately led to collapse of support for democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench in the early st century republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the alabama state board of education in republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in years the last remaining statewide democrat who served on the alabama public service commission was defeated in only two republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of reconstruction when republicans generally represented reconstruction government including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise the two gop lt governors were steve windom and the current lt governor kay ivey who was elected in and re elected in local elections many local offices county commissioners boards of education tax assessors tax collectors etc in the state are still held by democrats many rural counties have voters who are majority democrats resulting in local elections being decided in the democratic primary similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority republican and elections are effectively decided in the republican primary although there are exceptions alabama county sheriffs are elected in partisan at large races and democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts the current split is democrats republicans and one independent fayette however most of the democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties the majority of republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban suburban and heavily populated counties the state of alabama has one female sheriff in morgan county alabama and ten african american sheriffs federal elections presidential elections results year republican democratic

aristotle aristotélēs bc was an ancient greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of stagira chalkidice on the northern periphery of classical greece his father nicomachus died when aristotle was child whereafter proxenus of atarneus became his guardian at seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined plato academy in athens and remained there until the age of thirty seven bc his writings cover many subjects including physics biology zoology metaphysics logic ethics aesthetics poetry theater music rhetoric psychology linguistics politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of western philosophy shortly after plato died aristotle left athens and at the request of philip ii of macedon tutored alexander the great beginning in bc teaching alexander the great gave aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies he established library in the lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books which were written on papyrus scrolls the fact that aristotle was pupil of plato contributed to his former views of platonism but following plato death aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from platonism to empiricism he believed all peoples concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception aristotle views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works aristotle views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship their influence extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics some of aristotle zoological observations such as on the hectocotyl reproductive arm of the octopus were not confirmed or refuted until the th century his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic which was incorporated in the late th century into modern formal logic in metaphysics aristotelianism profoundly influenced jewish and islamic philosophical and theological thought during the middle ages and continues to influence christian theology especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the catholic church aristotle was well known among medieval muslim scholars and has been revered as the first teacher his ethics though always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics all aspects of aristotle philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues cicero described his literary style as river of gold it is thought that only around third of his original output has survived life mieza macedonia greece aristotle whose name means the best purpose was born in bc in stagira chalcidice about km miles east of modern day thessaloniki his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon aristotle was orphaned at young age although there is little information on aristotle childhood he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy aristotle by francesco hayez portrait bust of aristotle an imperial roman st or nd century ad copy of lost bronze sculpture made by lysippos at the age of seventeen or eighteen aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at plato academy he remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving athens in bc the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academy direction after control passed to plato nephew speusippus although it is possible that he feared anti macedonian sentiments and left before plato died aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor there he traveled with theophrastus to the island of lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island aristotle married pythias either hermias adoptive daughter or niece she bore him daughter whom they also named pythias soon after hermias death aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander in bc aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon during that time he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings ptolemy and cassander aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and his attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric in one famous example he counsels alexander to be leader to the greeks and despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants by bc aristotle had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira who bore him son whom he named after his father nicomachus according to the suda he also had an eromenos palaephatus of abydus this period in athens between and bc is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students his most important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics de anima on the soul and poetics aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time but made significant contributions to most of them in physical science aristotle studied anatomy astronomy embryology geography geology meteorology physics and zoology in philosophy he wrote on aesthetics ethics government metaphysics politics economics psychology rhetoric and theology he also studied education foreign customs literature and poetry his combined works constitute virtual encyclopedia of greek knowledge near the end of his life alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexander relationship with persia and persians widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing role in alexander death but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death following alexander death anti macedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled in bc demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety prompting him to flee to his mother family estate in chalcis on euboea at which occasion he was said to have stated will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy reference to athens prior trial and execution of socrates he died on euboea of natural causes later that same year having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife charles walston argues that the tomb of aristotle is located on the sacred way between chalcis and eretria and to have contained two styluses pen signet ring and some terra cottas as well as what is supposed to be the earthly remains of aristotle in the form of some skull fragments in general the details of the life of aristotle are not well established the biographies of aristotle written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on few salient points thought logic aristotle as portrayed in the nuremberg chronicle with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until th century advances in mathematical logic kant stated in the critique of pure reason preface to the second edition that with aristotle logic reached its completion history aristotle says that on the subject of reasoning he had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of however plato reports that syntax was devised before him by prodicus of ceos who was concerned by the correct use of words logic seems to have emerged from dialectics the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like reductio ad absurdum in their discussions but never truly understood the logical implications even plato had difficulties with logic although he had reasonable conception of deductive system he could never actually construct one thus he relied instead on his dialectic plato believed that deduction would simply follow from premises hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the conclusion would logically follow consequently plato realized that method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial he never succeeded in devising such method but his best attempt was published in his book sophist where he introduced his division method analytics and the organon what we today call aristotelian logic aristotle himself would have labeled analytics the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics most of aristotle work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers the logical works of aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early st century ce categories on interpretation prior analytics posterior analytics topics on sophistical refutations the order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle writings it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the analytics and dialectics in the topics and sophistical refutations the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning there is one volume of aristotle concerning logic not found in the organon namely the fourth book of metaphysics aristotle epistemology plato left and aristotle right detail of the school of athens fresco by raphael aristotle gestures to the earth representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience while holding copy of his nicomachean ethics in his hand whilst plato gestures to the heavens representing his belief in the forms while holding copy of timaeus ancient roman mosaic depicting aristotle römisch germanisches museum koln germany like his teacher plato aristotle philosophy aims at the universal aristotle ontology however finds the universal in particular things which he calls the essence of things while in plato ontology the universal exists apart from particular things and is related to them as their prototype or exemplar for aristotle therefore epistemology is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences while for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms or ideas and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these for aristotle form still refers to the unconditional basis of phenomena but is instantiated in particular substance see universals and particulars below in certain sense aristotle method is both inductive and deductive while plato is essentially deductive from priori principles in aristotle terminology natural philosophy is branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences in modern times the scope of philosophy has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries such as ethics and metaphysics in which logic plays major role today philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method in contrast aristotle philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry in the larger sense of the word aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science note however that his use of the term science carries different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method for aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical metaphysics by practical science he means ethics and politics by poetical science he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts by theoretical science he means physics mathematics and metaphysics if logic or analytics is regarded as study preliminary to philosophy the divisions of aristotelian philosophy would consist of logic theoretical philosophy including metaphysics physics and mathematics practical philosophy and poetical philosophy in the period between his two stays in athens between his times at the academy and the lyceum aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today in fact most of aristotle life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science aristotle metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics he did however perform original research in the natural sciences botany zoology physics astronomy chemistry meteorology and several other sciences aristotle writings on science are largely qualitative as opposed to quantitative beginning in the th century scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences and aristotle work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate his failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass velocity force and temperature he had conception of speed and temperature but no quantitative understanding of them which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices like clocks and thermometers his writings provide an account of many scientific observations mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors for example in his history of animals he claimed that human males have more teeth than females in similar vein john philoponus and later galileo showed by simple experiments that aristotle theory that heavier object falls faster than lighter object is incorrect on the other hand aristotle refuted democritus claim that the milky way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun rays pointing out correctly even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for long time that given current astronomical demonstrations that the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them aristotle also had some scientific blind spots he posited geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the metaphysics which was widely accepted up until the th century from the rd century to the th century the dominant view held that the earth was the rotational center of the universe because he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by european thinkers during and after the renaissance these thinkers often took aristotle erroneous positions as given which held back science in this epoch however aristotle scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields for instance he founded logic as formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia moreover he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants geology as quoted from charles lyell principles of geology he aristotle refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages he instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized he points to the growth of the nilotic delta since the time of homer to the shallowing of the palus maeotis within sixty years from his own time he alludes to the upheaving of one of the eolian islands previous to volcanic eruption the changes of the earth he says are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives that they are overlooked and the migrations of people after great catastrophes and their removal to other regions cause the event to be forgotten he says th chapter of his meteorics the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land and again it becomes land where it was sea and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to certain system and within certain period the concluding observation is as follows as time never fails and the universe is eternal neither the tanais nor the nile can have flowed for ever the places where they rise were once dry and there is limit to their operations but there is none to time so also of all other rivers they spring up and they perish and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others the same tracts therefore of the earth are not some always sea and others always continents but every thing changes in the course of time physics five elements aristotle proposed fifth element aether in addition to the four proposed earlier by empedocles earth which is cold and dry this corresponds to the modern idea of solid water which is cold and wet this corresponds to the modern idea of liquid air which is hot and wet this corresponds to the modern idea of gas fire which is hot and dry this corresponds to the modern ideas of plasma and heat aether which is the divine substance that makes up the heavenly spheres and heavenly bodies stars and planets each of the four earthly elements has its natural place all that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe the center of the earth water tends toward sphere surrounding the center air tends toward sphere surrounding the water sphere fire tends toward the lunar sphere in which the moon orbits when elements are moved out of their natural place they naturally move back towards it this is natural motion motion requiring no extrinsic cause so for example in water earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up in air rain falls and flame rises outside all the other spheres the heavenly fifth element manifested in the stars and planets moves in the perfection of circles motion aristotle defined motion as the actuality of potentiality as such aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of potential as transition toward potentially possible state because actuality and potentiality are normally opposites in aristotle other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous or that the addition of the as such to the definition is critical to understanding it causality the four causes aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors his name aitia is traditionally translated as cause but it does not always refer to temporal sequence it might be better translated as explanation but the traditional rendering will be employed here material cause describes the material out of which something is composed thus the material cause of table is wood and the material cause of car is rubber and steel it is not about action it does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino the formal cause is its form the arrangement of that matter it tells us what thing is that any thing is determined by the definition form pattern essence whole synthesis or archetype it embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws as the whole macrostructure is the cause of its parts relationship known as the whole part causation plainly put the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor and in the second place as intrinsic determining cause embodied in the matter formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist architect or engineer to create drawing the efficient cause is the primary source or that from which the change under consideration proceeds it identifies what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed and so suggests all sorts of agents nonliving or living acting as the sources of change or movement or rest representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect this covers the modern definitions of cause as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs so take the two dominoes this time of equal weighting the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over the final cause telos is its purpose or that for the sake of which thing exists or is done including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities the final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve this covers modern ideas of motivating causes such as volition need desire ethics or spiritual beliefs additionally things can be causes of one another causing each other reciprocally as hard work causes fitness and vice versa although not in the same way or function the one is as the beginning of change the other as the goal thus aristotle first suggested reciprocal or circular causality as relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect moreover aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects its presence and absence may result in different outcomes simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino because it cannot fall of its own accord aristotle marked two modes of causation proper prior causation and accidental chance causation all causes both proper and incidental can be spoken of as actual or potential and as generic or particular the same language refers to the effects of causes so that actual effects are assigned to operating causes generic effects to generic causes and particular effects to particular causes optics aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day the second oldest written evidence of camera obscura after mozi bc can be found in aristotle documentation of such device in bc in problemata aristotle apparatus contained dark chamber that had single small hole or aperture to allow for sunlight to enter aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was the sun would still be correctly displayed as round object in modern cameras this is analogous to the diaphragm aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased the image was magnified chance and spontaneity according to aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things it is from what is spontaneous but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance for better understanding of aristotle conception of chance it might be better to think of coincidence something takes place by chance if person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place but with the result of another thing not intended taking place for example person seeks donations that person may find another person willing to donate substantial sum however if the person seeking the donations met the person donating not for the purpose of collecting donations but for some other purpose aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator result of chance it must be unusual that something happens by chance in other words if something happens all or most of the time we cannot say that it is by chance there is also more specific kind of chance which aristotle names luck that can only apply to human beings because it is in the sphere of moral actions according to aristotle luck must involve choice and thus deliberation and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice what is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance metaphysics aristotle defines metaphysics as the knowledge of immaterial being or of being in the highest degree of abstraction he refers to metaphysics as first philosophy as well as the theologic science substance potentiality and actuality aristotle examines the concepts of substance and essence ousia in his metaphysics book vii and he concludes that particular substance is combination of both matter and form in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed for example the matter of house is the bricks stones timbers etc or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia see also predicables that let us define something as house the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form with regard to the change kinesis and its causes now as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption he distinguishes the coming to be from growth and diminution which is change in quantity locomotion which is change in space and alteration which is change in quality the coming to be is change where nothing persists of which the resultant is property in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality dynamis and actuality entelecheia in association with the matter and the form referring to potentiality this is what thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else for example the seed of plant in the soil is potentially dynamei plant and if is not prevented by something it will become plant potentially beings can either act poiein or be acted upon paschein which can be either innate or learned for example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight innate being acted upon while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning exercise acting actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality because the end telos is the principle of every change and for the sake of the end exists potentiality therefore actuality is the end referring then to our previous example we could say that an actuality is when plant does one of the activities that plants do for that for the sake of which thing is is its principle and the becoming is for the sake of the end and the actuality is the end and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired for animals do not see in order that they may have sight but they have sight that they may see in summary the matter used to make house has potentiality to be house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also final cause or end then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality with this definition of the particular substance matter and form aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes man one since according to plato there are two ideas animal and biped how then is man unity however according to aristotle the potential being matter and the actual one form are one and the same thing universals and particulars aristotle predecessor plato argued that all things have universal form which could be either property or relation to other things when we look at an apple for example we see an apple and we can also analyze form of an apple in this distinction there is particular apple and universal form of an apple moreover we can place an apple next to book so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not part of particular things for example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still proper universal form bertrand russell is th century philosopher who agreed with plato on the existence of uninstantiated universals aristotle disagreed with plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things according to aristotle if universal exists either as particular or relation then there must have been must be currently or must be in the future something on which the universal can be predicated consequently according to aristotle if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time then it does not exist in addition aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals as plato spoke of the world of the forms location where all universal forms subsist aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated so according to aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms biology and medicine in aristotelian science especially in biology things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others which contain error and superstition he dissected animals but not humans his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded empirical research program octopus swimming torpedo fuscomaculata leopard shark aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of lesbos and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas the works that reflect this research the history of animals generation of animals movement of animals and parts of animals contain some observations and interpretations along with sundry myths and mistakes the most striking passages are about the sea life visible from observation on lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen his observations on catfish electric fish torpedo and angler fish are detailed as is his writing on cephalopods namely octopus sepia cuttlefish and the paper nautilus argonauta argo his description of the hectocotyl arm used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the th century he separated the aquatic mammals from fish and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called selachē greek for sharks an example of his methods including dissection and observation comes from the generation of animals where he describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to discover the sequence in which visible organs are generated aristotle gave accurate descriptions of the four chambered fore stomachs of ruminants and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark mustelus mustelus classification of living things aristotle distinguished about species of birds mammals and fishes what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates aristotle called animals with blood and animals without blood animals with blood were divided into live bearing mammals and egg bearing birds and fish invertebrates animals without blood are insects crustacea divided into non shelled cephalopods and shelled and testacea molluscs aristotle believed that intellectual purposes final causes guided all natural processes such teleological view gave aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design noting that no animal has at the same time both tusks and horns and single hooved animal with two horns have never seen aristotle suggested that nature giving no animal both horns and tusks was staving off vanity and giving creatures faculties only to such degree as they are necessary noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter with nature trying to preserve type of balance he stated in the history of animals that creatures were arranged in graded scale of perfection rising from minerals to plants and animals and on up to man forming the scala naturae or great chain of being his system had eleven grades arranged according to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality expressed in their form at birth the highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive the lowest bore theirs cold dry and in thick eggs for charles singer nothing is more remarkable than aristotle efforts to exhibit the relationships of living things as scala naturae aristotle also held that the level of creature perfection was reflected in its form but not preordained by that form ideas like this and his ideas about souls are not regarded as science at all in modern times he placed emphasis on the type of soul an organism possessed asserting that plants possess vegetative soul responsible for reproduction and growth animals vegetative and sensitive soul responsible for mobility and sensation and humans vegetative sensitive and rational soul capable of thought and reflection aristotle in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the egyptians placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain notable is aristotle division of sensation and thought which generally went against previous philosophers with the exception of alcmaeon successor theophrastus frontispiece to version of the expanded and illustrated edition of historia plantarum ca which was originally written around bc aristotle successor at the lyceum theophrastus wrote series of books on botany the history of plants which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany even into the middle ages many of theophrastus names survive into modern times such as carpos for fruit and pericarpion for seed vessel rather than focus on formal causes as aristotle did theophrastus suggested mechanistic scheme drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes and relying on aristotle concept of the efficient cause theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants though this last discovery was lost in later ages influence on hellenistic medicine after theophrastus the lyceum failed to produce any original work though interest in aristotle ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found the first medical teacher at alexandria herophilus of chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not though few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life teleology and after the rise of christianity natural theology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the th and th centuries ernst mayr claimed that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance aristotle ideas of natural history and medicine survived but they were generally taken unquestioningly psychology aristotle psychology given in his treatise on the soul peri psyche often known by its latin title de anima posits three kinds of soul psyches the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul humans have rational soul this kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally the unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them for aristotle the soul psyche was simpler concept than it is for us today by soul he simply meant the form of living being because all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings the ability to initiate movement or in the case of plants growth and chemical transformations which aristotle considers types of movement memory according to aristotle memory is the ability to hold perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past in other words memory is mental picture phantasm in which aristotle defines in de anima as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms memory aristotle believed an imprint becomes impressed on semi fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make memory memory occurs when stimuli is too complex that the nervous system semi fluid bodily organ cannot receive all the impressions at once these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation common sense and thinking the mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception it does not matter if the experience was seen or heard every experience ends up as mental image in memory aristotle uses the word memory for two basic abilities first the actual retaining of the experience in the mnemonic imprint that can develop from sensation second the intellectual anxiety that comes with the imprint due to being impressed at particular time and processing specific contents these abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after lapse of time therefore memory is of the past prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present the retrieval of our imprints cannot be performed suddenly transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences both for our previous experience and present experience aristotle proposed that slow witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the imprint can easily continue however they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new imprints he believed the young and the old do not properly develop an imprint young people undergo rapid changes as they develop while the elderly organs are beginning to decay thus stunting new imprints likewise people who are too quick witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ because intellectual functions are not involved in memory memories belong to some animals too but only those in which have perception of time recollection because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or imprints people are continually weaving together new imprints of things they experience in order to search for these imprints people search the memory itself within the memory if one experience is offered instead of specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for recollection occurs when one experience naturally follows another if the chain of images is needed one memory will stimulate the other if the chain of images is not needed but expected then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances when people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed recollection is the self directed activity of retrieving the information stored in memory imprint after some time has passed retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of being human or animal and the abilities the human or animal possesses only humans will remember imprints of intellectual activity such as numbers and words animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed recollection of an imprint is when the present experiences person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences when an imprint is recalled it may bring forth large group of related imprints aristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain imprints was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships similarity contrast and contiguity these three laws make up his laws of association aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience according to aristotle association is the power innate in mental state which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences allowing them to rise and be recalled dreams sleep before understanding aristotle views on dreams first his idea of sleep must be examined aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in on sleep and wakefulness sleep takes place as result of overuse of the senses or of digestion so it is vital to the body including the senses so it can be revitalized while person is asleep the critical activities which include thinking sensing recalling and remembering do not function as they do during wakefulness since person cannot sense during sleep they can also not have desire which is the result of sensation however the senses are able to work during sleep albeit differently than when person is awake because during sleep person can still have sensory experiences also not all of the senses are inactive during sleep only the ones that are weary theory of dreams dreams do not involve actually sensing stimulus because as discussed the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep in dreams sensation is still involved but in an altered manner than when awake aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when person stares at moving stimulus such as the waves in body of water when they look away from that stimulus the next thing they look at appears to be moving in wave like motion when person perceives stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention it leaves an impression when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant however during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made so dreams result from these lasting impressions since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake during sleep person is in an altered state of mind aristotle compares sleeping person to person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward stimulus for example person who has strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings when person is asleep their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like person who is influenced by strong feelings since person sleeping is in this suggestible state they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams when asleep person is unable to make judgments as they do when they are awake due to the senses not functioning normally during sleep they are unable to help person judge what is happening in their dream this in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not so the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it one component of aristotle theory of dreams introduces ideas that are contradictory to previously held beliefs he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and that they are not sent by divine being aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are happenstances not divinations these ideas were contradictory to what had been believed about dreams but at the time in which he introduced these ideas more thinkers were beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to phenomena aristotle also includes in his theory of dreams what constitutes dream and what does not he claimed that dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it if person had an image appear for moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered dream because they were awake when it occurred secondly any sensory experience that actually occurs while person is asleep and is perceived by the person while asleep does not qualify as part of dream for example if while person is sleeping door shuts and in their dream they hear door is shut aristotle argues that this sensory experience is not part of the dream the actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep does not make it part of the dream lastly the images of dreams must be result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when awake practical philosophy ethics aristotle considered ethics to be practical rather than theoretical study one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake he wrote several treatises on ethics including most notably the nicomachean ethics aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ergon of thing an eye is only good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight aristotle reasoned that humans must have function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē normally translated as soul in accordance with reason logos aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes well being to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires good character ēthikē aretē often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence aristotle taught that to achieve virtuous and potentially happy character requires first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom phronesis and their intellect nous can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words philosopher politics aristotle classification of constitutions in addition to his works on ethics which address the individual aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics aristotle considered the city to be natural community moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part he also famously stated that man is by nature political animal and also arguing that humanity defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like machine and as collection of parts none of which can exist without the others aristotle conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner the common modern understanding of political community as modern state is quite different from aristotle understanding although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to aristotle was the city polis which functions as political community or partnership koinōnia the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live good life and to perform beautiful acts the political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together this is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences excerpt from speech by the character aristotle in the book protrepticus hutchinson and johnson for we all agree that the most excellent man should rule the supreme by nature and that the law rules and alone is authoritative but the law is kind of intelligence discourse based on intelligence and again what standard do we have what criterion of good things that is more precise than the intelligent man for all that this man will choose if the choice is based on his knowledge are good things and their contraries are bad and since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions just man choosing to live justly man with bravery to live bravely likewise self controlled man to live with self control it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent for this is the function of that capacity hence it evident that according to the most authoritative judgment intelligence is supreme among goods rhetoric and poetics aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry and music to be imitative each varying in imitation by medium object and manner for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language the forms also differ in their object of imitation comedy for instance is dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind advantages over animals while it is believed that aristotle poetics comprised two books one on comedy and one on tragedy only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements plot structure character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry the characters in tragedy are merely means of driving the story and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions aristotle concludes poetics with discussion on which if either is superior epic or tragic mimesis he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic aristotle was keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and proverbs he and his school had special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop views on women aristotle analysis of procreation describes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive female element on this ground feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism however aristotle gave equal weight to women happiness as he did to men and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men loss and preservation of his works first page of edition of the nicomachean ethics in greek and latin aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls or rolls which was the common writing medium of that era modern scholarship reveals that aristotle lost works stray considerably in from the surviving aristotelian corpus whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication the surviving works do not appear to have been so rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication the authenticity of portion of the surviving works as originally aristotelian is also today held suspect with some books duplicating or summarizing each other the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely aristotle at all some of the individual works within the corpus including the constitution of athens are regarded by most scholars as products of aristotle school perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision others such as on colors may have been produced by aristotle successors at the lyceum theophrastus and straton still others acquired aristotle name through similarities in doctrine or content such as the de plantis possibly by nicolaus of damascus other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and astrological and magical texts whose connections to aristotle are purely fanciful and self promotional according to distinction that originates with aristotle himself his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric and the esoteric most scholars have understood this as distinction between works aristotle intended for the public exoteric and the more technical works intended for use within the lyceum course school esoteric modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be aristotle own unpolished lecture notes or in some cases possible notes by his students however one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation the th century neoplatonist ammonius hermiae writes that aristotle writing style is deliberately obscurantist so that good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant that all of aristotle extant writings are of the esoteric kind current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious though many of them may have been in dialogue form fragments of some of aristotle dialogues have survived perhaps it is to these that cicero refers when he characterized aristotle writing style as river of gold it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us however some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that cicero praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in aristotle extant works one major question in the history of aristotle works then is how were the exoteric writings all lost and how did the ones we now possess come to us the story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by strabo in his geography and plutarch in his parallel lives the manuscripts were left from aristotle to his successor theophrastus who in turn willed them to neleus of scepsis neleus supposedly took the writings from athens to scepsis where his heirs let them languish in cellar until the st century bc when apellicon of teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts bringing them back to athens according to the story apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts stay in the basement introducing number of errors into the text when lucius cornelius sulla occupied athens in bc he carried off the library of apellicon to rome where they were first published in bc by the grammarian tyrannion of amisus and then by the philosopher andronicus of rhodes carnes lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the peripatetic school after the middle of the third century and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of aristotle throughout the hellenistic period as well as for the sudden reappearance of flourishing aristotelianism during the first century lord voices number of reservations concerning this story however first the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by apellicon inexpert attempt at repair second there is evidence lord says that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which strabo and plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in scepsis third the definitive edition of aristotle texts seems to have been made in athens some fifty years before andronicus supposedly compiled his and fourth ancient library catalogues predating andronicus intervention list an aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess lord sees number of post aristotelian interpolations in the politics for example but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact on the one hand the surviving texts of aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts but rather from working drafts used within aristotle school as opposed on the other hand to the dialogues and other exoteric texts which aristotle published more widely during his lifetime the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotle school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today legacy aristotle by jusepe de ribera aristotle with bust of homer by rembrandt thirteenth century islamic portrayal of aristotle statue by cipri adolf bermann at the university of freiburg more than years after his death aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields according to the philosopher bryan magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did among countless other achievements aristotle was the founder of formal logic pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method despite these achievements the influence of aristotle errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably bertrand russell notes that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine russell also refers to aristotle ethics as repulsive and calls his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors later greek philosophers the immediate influence of aristotle work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school aristotle notable students included aristoxenus dicaearchus demetrius of phalerum eudemos of rhodes harpalus hephaestion mnason of phocis nicomachus and theophrastus aristotle influence over alexander the great is seen in the latter bringing with him on his expedition host of zoologists botanists and researchers he had also learned great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotle geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines for in what shall surpass other men if those doctrines wherein have been trained are to be all men common property influence on byzantine scholars greek christian scribes played crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were john philoponus elias and david in the sixth century and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century john philoponus stands out for having attempted fundamental critique of aristotle views on the eternity of the world movement and other elements of aristotelian thought after hiatus of several centuries formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries apparently sponsored by anna comnena influence on islamic theologians aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology most of the still extant works of aristotle as well as number of the original greek commentaries were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers scientists and scholars averroes avicenna and alpharabius who wrote on aristotle in great depth also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers alkindus considered aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the first teacher the title teacher was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars and was later used by western philosophers as in the famous poem of dante who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy in accordance with the greek theorists the muslims considered aristotle to be dogmatic philosopher the author of closed system and believed that aristotle shared with plato essential tenets of thought some went so far as to credit aristotle himself with neo platonic metaphysical ideas influence on western christian theologians with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west aristotle was practically unknown there from ad to except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made both from arabic translations such as those by gerard of cremona and from the original greek such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke after thomas aquinas wrote his theology working from moerbeke translations the demand for aristotle writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west stimulating revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance aristotle is referred to as the philosopher by scholastic thinkers such as thomas aquinas see summa theologica part question etc these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages it required repudiation of some aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods the medieval english poet chaucer describes his student as being happy by having at his beddes heed twenty bookes clad in blak or reed of aristotle and his philosophie the italian poet dante says of aristotle in the first circles of hell vidi maestro di color che sanno seder tra filosofica famiglia tutti lo miran tutti onor li fanno quivi vid ïo socrate platone che nnanzi li altri più presso li stanno saw the master there of those who know amid the philosophic family by all admired and by all reverenced there plato too saw and socrates who stood beside him closer than the rest dante inferno hell canto iv lines post enlightenment thinkers the german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle however debatable this is aristotle rigidly separated action from production and argued for the deserved subservience of some people natural slaves and the natural superiority virtue arete of others it is martin heidegger not nietzsche who elaborated new interpretation of aristotle intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition ayn rand accredited aristotle as the greatest philosopher in history and cited him as major influence on her thinking more recently alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in way that is anti elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans list of works the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through

apollo attic ionic and homeric greek apollōn doric apellōn arcadocypriot apeilōn aeolic aploun is one of the most important and complex of the olympian deities in classical greek and roman religion and greek and roman mythology the ideal of the kouros beardless athletic youth apollo has been variously recognized as god of music truth and prophecy healing the sun and light plague poetry and more apollo is the son of zeus and leto and has twin sister the chaste huntress artemis apollo is known in greek influenced etruscan mythology as apulu as the patron of delphi pythian apollo apollo was an oracular god the prophetic deity of the delphic oracle medicine and healing are associated with apollo whether through the god himself or mediated through his son asclepius yet apollo was also seen as god who could bring ill health and deadly plague amongst the god custodial charges apollo became associated with dominion over colonists and as the patron defender of herds and flocks as the leader of the muses apollon musegetes and director of their choir apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry hermes created the lyre for him and the instrument became common attribute of apollo hymns sung to apollo were called paeans in hellenistic times especially during the rd century bce as apollo helios he became identified among greeks with helios titan god of the sun and his sister artemis similarly equated with selene titan goddess of the moon in latin texts on the other hand joseph fontenrose declared himself unable to find any conflation of apollo with sol among the augustan poets of the st century not even in the conjurations of aeneas and latinus in aeneid xii apollo and helios sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the rd century ce etymology apollo seated with lyre porphyry and marble nd century ad farnese collection naples italy the name apollo unlike the related older name paean is generally not found in the linear mycenean greek texts although there is possible attestation in the lacunose form pe rjo linear on the kn tablet the etymology of the name is uncertain the spelling in classical attic had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era but the doric form apellon is more archaic as it is derived from an earlier it probably is cognate to the doric month apellaios and the offerings apellaia at the initiation of the young men during the family festival apellai according to some scholars the words are derived from the doric word apella which originally meant wall fence for animals and later assembly within the limits of the square apella is the name of the popular assembly in sparta corresponding to the ecclesia beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun apellai and suggested pre greek proto form apalyun several instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors thus the greeks most often associated apollo name with the greek verb apollymi to destroy plato in cratylus connects the name with apolysis redemption with apolousis purification and with haploun simple in particular in reference to the thessalian form of the name and finally with aeiballon ever shooting hesychius connects the name apollo with the doric apella which means assembly so that apollo would be the god of political life and he also gives the explanation sekos fold in which case apollo would be the god of flocks and herds in the ancient macedonian language pella means stone and some toponyms may be derived from this word pella the capital of ancient macedonia and pellēnē pallene number of non greek etymologies have been suggested for the name the hittite form apaliunas is attested in the manapa tarhunta letter perhaps related to hurrian and certainly the etruscan aplu god of plague in turn likely from akkadian aplu enlil meaning simply the son of enlil title that was given to the god nergal who was linked to shamash babylonian god of the sun the role of apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of apollo smintheus mouse apollo by chryses the trojan priest of apollo with the purpose of sending plague against the greeks the reasoning behind god of the plague becoming god of healing is of course apotropaic meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague the hittite testimony reflects an early form which may also be surmised from comparison of cypriot with doric luwian etymology suggested for apaliunas makes apollo the one of entrapment perhaps in the sense of hunter greco roman epithets apollo chief epithet was phoebus phoibos literally bright it was very commonly used by both the greeks and romans for apollo role as the god of light like other greek

omphalos in the museum of delphi the cult centers of apollo in greece delphi and delos date from the th century bce the delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to artemis apollo twin sister at delphi apollo was venerated as the slayer of pytho for the greeks apollo was all the gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods in archaic greece he was the prophet the oracular god who in older times was connected with healing in classical greece he was the god of light and of music but in popular religion he had strong function to keep away evil walter burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of apollo worship which he termed dorian northwest greek component cretan minoan component and syro hittite component from his eastern origin apollo brought the art of inspection of symbols and omina σημεία και τέρατα semeia kai terata and of the observation of the omens of the days the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced from anatolia the ritualism belonged to apollo from the beginning the greeks created the legalism the supervision of the orders of the gods and the demand for moderation and harmony apollo became the god of shining youth the protector of music spiritual life moderation and perceptible order the improvement of the old anatolian god and his elevation to an intellectual sphere may be considered an achievement of the greek people healer and god protector from evil the function of apollo as healer is connected with paean the physician of the gods in the iliad who seems to come from more primitive religion paeοn is probably connected with the mycenean pa ja wo ne linear but this is not certain he did not have separate cult but he was the personification of the holy magic song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease later the greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song paean the magicians were also called seer doctors and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god apollo at the oracles in the iliad apollo is the healer under the gods but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows similar to the function of the vedic god of disease rudra he sends plague to the achaeans the god who sends disease can also prevent it therefore when it stops they make purifying ceremony and offer him hecatomb to ward off evil when the oath of his priest appeases they pray and with song they call their own god the paean some common epithets of apollo as healer are paion literally healer or helper epikourios help oulios healed wound also scar and loimios plague in classical times his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil and was therefore called apotropaios divert deter avert and alexikakos from defend from evil in later writers the word usually spelled paean becomes mere epithet of apollo in his capacity as god of healing homer illustrated paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph such songs were originally addressed to apollo and afterwards to other gods to dionysus to apollo helios to apollo son asclepius the healer about the th century bce the paean became merely formula of adulation its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered it was in this way that apollo had become recognised as the god of music apollo role as the slayer of the python led to his association with battle and victory hence it became the roman custom for paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle when fleet left the harbour and also after victory had been won dorian origin apollo victorious over the python by the florentine pietro francavilla dated depicting apollo first triumph when he slew with his bow and arrows the serpent python which lies dead at his feet the walters art museum the connection with the dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month apellaios in northwest greek calendars the family festival was dedicated to apollo doric apellaios is the month of these rites and apellon is the megistos kouros the great kouros however it can explain only the doric type of the name which is connected with the ancient macedonian word pella pella stone stones played an important part in the cult of the god especially in the oracular shrine of delphi omphalos the homeric hymn represents apollo as northern intruder his arrival must have occurred during the dark ages that followed the destruction of the mycenaean civilization and his conflict with gaia mother earth was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent python the earth deity had power over the ghostly world and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle the older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated female dragon named delphyne womb and male serpent typhon to smoke the adversary of zeus in the titanomachy who the narrators confused with python python was the good daemon ἀγαθὸς δαίμων of the temple as it appears in minoan religion but she was represented as dragon as often happens in northern european folklore as well as in the east apollo and his sister artemis can bring death with their arrows the conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings or magicians is common in germanic and norse mythology in greek mythology artemis was the leader hegemon of the nymphs who had similar functions with the nordic elves the elf shot originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves but it was later attested denoting stone arrow heads which were used by witches to harm people and also for healing rituals the vedic rudra has some similar functions with apollo the terrible god is called the archer and the bow is also an attribute of shiva rudra could bring diseases with his arrows but he was able to free people of them and his alternative shiba is healer physician god however the indo european component of apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens exorcisms and with the oracular cult minoan origin minoan labrys it seems an oracular cult existed in delphi from the mycenaean age in historical times the priests of delphi were called labryaden the double axe men which indicates minoan origin the double axe labrys was the holy symbol of the cretan labyrinth the homeric hymn adds that apollo appeared as dolphin and carried cretan priests to delphi where they evidently transferred their religious practices apollo delphinios or delphidios was sea god especially worshiped in crete and in the islands apollo sister artemis who was the greek goddess of hunting is identified with britomartis diktynna the minoan mistress of the animals in her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the mister of the animals male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute his original name is unknown but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular apollo who stood by the virgin mistress of the animals becoming her brother the old oracles in delphi seem to be connected with local tradition of the priesthood and there is not clear evidence that kind of inspiration prophecy existed in the temple this led some scholars to the conclusion that pythia carried on the rituals in consistent procedure through many centuries according to the local tradition in that regard the mythical seeress sibyl of anatolian origin with her ecstatic art looks unrelated to the oracle itself however the greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel leaves which seem to be confirmed by recent studies plato describes the priestesses of delphi and dodona as frenzied women obsessed by mania frenzy greek word he connected with mantis prophet frenzied women like sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the near east as mari in the second millennium bc although crete had contacts with mari from bc there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the minoan and mycenean ages it is more probable that this art was introduced later from anatolia and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to delphi and dormant in several areas of greece anatolian origin illustration of coin of apollo agyieus from ambracia non greek origin of apollo has long been assumed in scholarship the name of apollo mother leto has lydian origin and she was worshipped on the coasts of asia minor the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into greece from anatolia which is the origin of sibyl and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines omens symbols purifications and exorcisms appear in old assyro babylonian texts and these rituals were spread into the empire of the hittites in hittite text is mentioned that the king invited babylonian priestess for certain purification similar story is mentioned by plutarch he writes that the cretan seer epimenides purified athens after the pollution brought by the alcmeonidae and that the seer expertise in sacrifices and reform of funeral practices were of great help to solon in his reform of the athenian state the story indicates that epimenides was probably heir to the shamanic religions of asia and proves together with the homeric hymn that crete had resisting religion up to historical times it seems that these rituals were dormant in greece and they were reinforced when the greeks migrated to anatolia homer pictures apollo on the side of the trojans fighting against the achaeans during the trojan war he is pictured as terrible god less trusted by the greeks than other gods the god seems to be related to appaliunas tutelary god of wilusa troy in asia minor but the word is not complete the stones found in front of the gates of homeric troy were the symbols of apollo the greeks gave to him the name agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was tapered stone or column however while usually greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon all the feasts of apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month and the emphasis given to that day sibutu indicates babylonian origin the late bronze age from to bce hittite and hurrian aplu was god of plague invoked during plague years here we have an apotropaic situation where god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it aplu meaning the son of was title given to the god nergal who was linked to the babylonian god of the sun shamash homer interprets apollo as terrible god who brings death and disease with his arrows but who can also heal possessing magic art that separates him from the other greek gods in iliad his priest prays to apollo smintheus the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats all these functions including the function of the healer god paean who seems to have mycenean origin are fused in the cult of apollo oracular cult temple of apollo at delphi greece unusually among the olympic deities apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence delos and delphi in cult practice delian apollo and pythian apollo the apollo of delphi were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality apollo cult was already fully established when written sources commenced about bce apollo became extremely important to the greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period and the frequency of theophoric names such as apollodorus or apollonios and cities named apollonia testify to his popularity oracular sanctuaries to apollo were established in other sites in the nd and rd century ce those at didyma and clarus pronounced the so called theological oracles in which apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all encompassing highest deity in the rd century apollo fell silent julian the apostate tried to revive the delphic oracle but failed oracular shrines delos lions apollo had famous oracle in delphi and other notable ones in clarus and branchidae his oracular shrine in abae in phocis where he bore the toponymic epithet abaeus apollon abaios was important enough to be consulted by croesus his oracular shrines include abae in phocis bassae in the peloponnese at clarus on the west coast of asia minor as at delphi holy spring which gave off pneuma from which the priests drank in corinth the oracle of corinth came from the town of tenea from prisoners supposedly taken in the trojan war at khyrse in troad the temple was built for apollo smintheus in delos there was an oracle to the delian apollo during summer the hieron sanctuary of apollo adjacent to the sacred lake was the place where the god was said to have been born in delphi the pythia became filled with the pneuma of apollo said to come from spring inside the adyton in didyma an oracle on the coast of anatolia south west of lydian luwian sardis in which priests from the lineage of the branchidae received inspiration by drinking from healing spring located in the temple was believed to have been founded by branchus son or lover of apollo in hierapolis bambyce syria modern manbij according to the treatise de dea syria the sanctuary of the syrian goddess contained robed and bearded image of apollo divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image at patara in lycia there was seasonal winter oracle of apollo said to have been the place where the god went from delos as at delphi the oracle at patara was woman in segesta in sicily oracles were also given by sons of apollo in oropus north of athens the oracle amphiaraus was said to be the son of apollo oropus also had sacred spring in labadea east of delphi trophonius another son of apollo killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle temples of apollo many temples were dedicated to apollo in greece and the greek colonies they show the spread of the cult of apollo and the evolution of the greek architecture which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations some of the earliest temples especially in crete do not belong to any greek order it seems that the first peripteral temples were rectanglular wooden structures the different wooden elements were considered divine and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of doric order the greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances the temples should be canonic and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection from the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings the first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms this probably influenced the theory of numbers of pythagoras who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics the doric order dominated during the th and the th century bc but there was mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs which couldn be solved without changing the original forms the order was almost abandoned for the ionic order but the ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of temple both orders were abandoned for the corinthian order gradually during the hellenistic age and under rome the most important temples are greek temples thebes greece the oldest temple probably dedicated to apollo ismenius was built in the th century it seems that it was curvilinear building the doric temple was built in the early th century but only some small parts have been found festival called daphnephoria was celebrated every ninth year in honour of apollo ismenius or galaxius the people held laurel branches daphnai and at the head of the procession walked youth chosen priest of apollo who was called daphnephoros eretria according to the homeric hymn to apollo the god arrived to the plain seeking for location to establish its oracle the first temple of apollo daphnephoros apollo laurel bearer or carrying off daphne is dated to the temple was curvilinear hecatombedon hundred feet in smaller building were kept the bases of the laurel branches which were used for the first building another temple probably peripteral

etruria there was prostyle porch which is called tuscan and triple cella wide falerii veteres etruria temple of apollo was built probably in the th rd century parts of teraccotta capital and teraccotta base have been found it seems that the etruscan columns were derived from the archaic doric cult of apollo soranus is attested by one inscription found near falerii plan of the temple of apollo pompeii pompeii italy the cult of apollo was widespread in the region of campania since the th century the temple was built in but its beginnings lie in the th century it was reconstructed after an earthquake in it demonstrates mixing of styles which formed the basis of roman architecture the columns in front of the cella formed tuscan prostyle porch and the cella is situated unusually far back the peripteral colonnade of ionic columns was placed in such way that the emphasis was given to the front side rome the temple of apollo sosianus and the temple of apollo medicus the first temple building dates to and was dedicated to apollo medicus the doctor after plague of it was rebuilt by gaius sosius probably in only three columns with corinthian capitals exist today it seems that

dedicated by augustus on the façade of the original temple was ionic and it was constructed from solid blocks of marble many famous statues by greek masters were on display in and around the temple including marble statue of the god at the entrance and statue of apollo in the cella melite modern mdina malta temple of apollo was built in the city in the nd century its remains were discovered in the th century and many of its architectural fragments were dispersed among private collections or reworked into new sculptures parts of the temple podium were rediscovered in mythology birth apollo left and artemis brygos potter signed tondo of an attic red figure cup bc musée du louvre when zeus wife hera discovered that leto was pregnant and that zeus was the father she banned leto from giving birth on terra firma in her wanderings leto found the newly created floating island of delos which was neither mainland nor real island she gave birth there and was accepted by the people offering them her promise that her son would be always favourable toward the city afterwards zeus secured delos to the bottom of the ocean this island later became sacred to apollo it is also stated that hera kidnapped eileithyia the goddess of childbirth to prevent leto from going into labor the other gods tricked hera into letting her go by offering her necklace of amber long mythographers agree that artemis was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of apollo or that artemis was born one day before apollo on the island of ortygia and that she helped leto cross the sea to delos the next day to give birth to apollo apollo was born on the seventh day hebdomagenes of the month thargelion according to delian tradition or of the month bysios according to delphian tradition the seventh and twentieth the days of the new and full moon were ever afterwards held sacred to him youth four days after his birth apollo killed the chthonic dragon python which lived in delphi beside the castalian spring this was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at delphi to give her prophecies hera sent the serpent to hunt leto to her death across the world to protect his mother apollo begged hephaestus for bow and arrows after receiving them apollo cornered python in the sacred cave at delphi apollo killed python but had to be punished for it since python was child of gaia hera then sent the giant tityos to rape leto this time apollo was aided by his sister artemis in protecting their mother during the battle zeus finally relented his aid and hurled tityos down to tartarus there he was pegged to the rock floor covering an area of where pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver trojan war marble bust of apollo after the apollo belvedere circa apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the greek encampment during the trojan war in retribution for agamemnon insult to chryses priest of apollo whose daughter chryseis had been captured he demanded her return and the achaeans complied indirectly causing the anger of achilles which is the theme of the iliad in the iliad when diomedes injured aeneas apollo rescued him first aphrodite tried to rescue aeneas but diomedes injured her as well aeneas was then enveloped in cloud by apollo who took him to pergamos sacred spot in troy apollo aided paris in the killing of achilles by guiding the arrow of his bow into achilles heel one interpretation of his motive is that it was in revenge for achilles sacrilege in murdering troilus the god own son by hecuba on the very altar of the god own temple admetus when zeus struck down apollo son asclepius with lightning bolt for resurrecting hippolytus from the dead transgressing themis by stealing hades subjects apollo in revenge killed the cyclopes who had fashioned the bolt for zeus apollo would have been banished to tartarus forever for this but was instead sentenced to one year of hard labor due to the intercession of his mother leto during this time he served as shepherd for king admetus of pherae in thessaly admetus treated apollo well and in return the god conferred great benefits on admetus apollo helped admetus win alcestis the daughter of king pelias and later convinced the fates to let admetus live past his time if another took his place but when it came time for admetus to die his parents whom he had assumed would gladly die for him refused to cooperate instead alcestis took his place but heracles managed to persuade thanatos the god of death to return her to the world of the living artemis and apollo piercing niobe children with their arrows by jacques louis david dallas museum of art niobe niobe the queen of thebes and wife of amphion boasted of her superiority to leto because she had fourteen children niobids seven male and seven female while leto had only two apollo killed her sons and artemis her daughters apollo and artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them though according to some versions of the myth number of the niobids were spared chloris usually amphion at the sight of his dead sons either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge devastated niobe fled to mount sipylos in asia minor and turned into stone as she wept her tears formed the river achelous zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death when the gods themselves entombed them consorts and children love affairs ascribed to apollo are late development in greek mythology their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the renaissance the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination female lovers apollo and daphne by bernini in the galleria borghese daphne was nymph daughter of the river god peneus who had scorned apollo the myth explains the connection of apollo with δάφνη daphnē the laurel whose leaves his priestess employed at delphi in ovid

orchamus the truth betraying her sister trust and confidence in her enraged orchamus ordered leucothea to be buried alive apollo refused to forgive clytia for betraying his beloved and grieving clytia wilted and slowly died apollo changed her into an incense plant either heliotrope or sunflower which follows the sun every day marpessa was kidnapped by idas but was loved by apollo as well zeus made her choose between them and she chose idas on the grounds that apollo being immortal would tire of her when she grew old castalia was nymph whom apollo loved she fled from him and dove into the spring at delphi at the base of mt parnassos which was then named after her water from this spring was sacred it was used to clean the delphian temples and inspire the priestesses in the last oracle is mentioned that the water which could speak has been lost for ever by cyrene apollo had son named aristaeus who became the patron god of cattle fruit trees hunting husbandry and bee keeping he was also culture hero and taught humanity dairy skills the use of nets and traps in hunting and how to cultivate olives hecuba was the wife of king priam of troy and apollo had son with her named troilus an oracle prophesied that troy would not be defeated as long as troilus reached the age of twenty alive he was ambushed and killed by achilleus cassandra was daughter of hecuba and priam and troilus half sister apollo fell in love with cassandra and promised her the gift of prophecy to seduce her but she rejected him afterwards enraged apollo indeed gave her the ability to know the future with curse that she could only see the future tragedies and that no one would ever believe her coronis was daughter of phlegyas king of the lapiths pregnant with asclepius coronis fell in love with ischys son of elatus crow informed apollo of the affair when first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black where they were previously white as punishment for spreading untruths when he found out the truth he sent his sister artemis to kill coronis in other stories apollo himself had killed coronis as result he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the centaur chiron to raise phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the temple of apollo at delphi apollo then killed him for what he did

apollonis borysthenis male lovers apollo and hyacinthus th century italian engraving by jacopo caraglio hyacinth or hyacinthus was one of apollo male lovers he was spartan prince beautiful and athletic the pair was practicing throwing the discus when discus thrown by apollo was blown off course by the jealous zephyrus and struck hyacinthus in the head killing him instantly apollo is said to be filled with grief out of hyacinthus blood apollo created flower named after him as memorial to his death and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection meaning alas the festival of hyacinthus was celebration of sparta another male lover was cyparissus descendant of heracles apollo gave him tame deer as companion but cyparissus accidentally killed it with javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth cyparissus asked apollo to let his tears fall forever apollo granted the request by turning him into the cypress named after him which was said to be sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk other male lovers of apollo include admetus atymnius otherwise known as beloved of sarpedon branchus alternately son of apollo carnus clarus hippolytus of sicyon not the same as hippolytus the son of theseus hymenaios iapis leucates who threw himself off rock when apollo attempted to carry him off phorbas probably the son of triopas potnieus apollo lyre apollo with his lyre statue from pergamon museum berlin hermes was born on mount cyllene in arcadia the story is told in the homeric hymn to hermes his mother maia had been secretly impregnated by zeus maia wrapped the infant in blankets but hermes escaped while she was asleep hermes ran to thessaly where apollo was grazing his cattle the infant hermes stole number of his cows and took them to cave in the woods near pylos covering their tracks in the cave he found tortoise and killed it then removed the insides he used one of the cow intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first lyre apollo complained to maia that her son had stolen his cattle but hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in so maia refused to believe apollo claim zeus intervened and claiming to have seen the events sided with apollo hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented apollo god of music fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre hence apollo then became master of the lyre apollo in the oresteia in aeschylus oresteia trilogy clytemnestra kills her husband king agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter iphigenia to proceed forward with the trojan war and cassandra prophetess of apollo apollo gives an order through the oracle at delphi that agamemnon son orestes is to kill clytemnestra and aegisthus her lover orestes and pylades carry out the revenge and consequently orestes is pursued by the erinyes or furies female of vengeance apollo and the furies argue about whether the matricide was justified apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and orestes was avenging his father whereas the erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage they invade his temple and he says that the matter should be brought before athena apollo promises to protect orestes as orestes has become apollo supplicant apollo advocates orestes at the trial and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo other stories apollo killed the aloadae when they attempted to storm mt olympus callimachus sang that apollo rode on the back of swan to the land of the hyperboreans during the winter months apollo turned cephissus into sea monster another contender for the birthplace of apollo is the cretan islands of paximadia musical contests pan once pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of apollo and to challenge apollo the god of the kithara the mountain god tmolus was chosen to umpire pan blew on his pipes and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower midas who happened to be present then apollo struck the strings of his lyre tmolus at once awarded the victory to apollo and all but midas agreed with the judgment he dissented and questioned the justice of the award apollo would not suffer such depraved pair of ears any longer and caused them to become the ears of donkey marsyas marsyas under apollo punishment istanbul archaeology museum apollo has ominous aspects aside from his plague bringing death dealing arrows marsyas was satyr who challenged apollo to contest of music he had found an aulos on the ground tossed away after being invented by athena because it made her cheeks puffy the contest was judged by the muses after they each performed both were deemed equal until apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time as apollo played the lyre this was easy to do marsyas could not do this as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time apollo was declared the winner because of this apollo flayed marsyas alive in cave near celaenae in phrygia for his hubris to challenge god he then nailed marsyas shaggy skin to nearby pine tree marsyas blood turned into the river marsyas another variation is that apollo played his instrument the lyre upside down marsyas could not do this with his instrument the flute and so apollo hung him from tree and flayed him alive cinyras apollo also had lyre playing contest with cinyras his son who committed suicide when he lost head of apollo marble roman copy of greek original of the th century bce from the collection of cardinal albani roman apollo the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks as greek god apollo had no direct roman equivalent although later roman poets often referred to him as phoebus there was tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of rome during the reign of tarquinius superbus on the occasion of pestilence in the bce apollo first temple at rome was established in the flaminian fields replacing an older cult site there known as the apollinare during the second punic war in bce the ludi apollinares apollonian games were instituted in his honor on the instructions of prophecy attributed to one marcius in the time of augustus who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome after the battle of actium which was fought near sanctuary of apollo augustus enlarged apollo temple dedicated portion of the spoils to him and instituted quinquennial games in his honour he also erected new temple to the god on the palatine hill sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to apollo and diana formed the culmination of the secular games held in bce to celebrate the dawn of new era festivals the chief apollonian festivals were the boedromia carneia carpiae daphnephoria delia hyacinthia metageitnia pyanepsia pythia and thargelia attributes and symbols apollo most common attributes were the bow and arrow other attributes of his included the kithara an advanced version of the common lyre the plectrum and the sword another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod representing his prophetic powers the pythian games were held in apollo honor every four years at delphi the bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games gold stater of the seleucid king antiochus soter reigned bce showing on the reverse nude apollo holding his key attributes two arrows and bow the palm tree was also sacred to apollo because he had been born under one in delos animals sacred to apollo included wolves dolphins roe deer swans cicadas symbolizing music and song hawks ravens crows snakes referencing apollo function as the god of prophecy mice and griffins mythical eagle lion hybrids of eastern origin apollo citharoedus apollo with kithara musei capitolini rome as god of colonization apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies especially during the height of colonization bce according to greek tradition he helped cretan or arcadian colonists found the city of troy however this story may reflect cultural influence which had the reverse direction hittite cuneiform texts mention minor asian god called appaliunas or apalunas in connection with the city of wilusa attested in hittite inscriptions which is now generally regarded as being identical with the greek ilion by most scholars in this interpretation apollo title of lykegenes can simply be read as born in lycia which effectively severs the god supposed link with wolves possibly folk etymology in literary contexts apollo represents harmony order and reason characteristics contrasted with those of dionysus god of wine who represents ecstasy and disorder the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian however the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary the two gods are brothers and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea he would leave the delphic oracle to dionysus this contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the borghese vase apollo is often associated with the golden mean this is the greek ideal of moderation and virtue that opposes gluttony apollo in the arts the louvre apollo sauroctonos roman copy after praxiteles bc apollo is common theme in greek and roman art and also in the art of the renaissance the earliest greek word for statue is delight agalma and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision greek art puts into apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined the sculptors derived this from observations on human beings but they also embodied in concrete form issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially religious activity the muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the greek desire for health and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard greek environment the statues of apollo embody beauty balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world the evolution of the greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal kouros type in early archaic period to the representation of motion in relative harmonious whole in late archaic period in classical greece the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole method created by polykleitos finally praxiteles seems to be released from any art and religious conformities and his masterpieces are mixture of naturalism with stylization art and greek philosophy the evolution of the greek art seems to go parallel with the greek philosophical conceptions which changed from the natural philosophy of thales to the metaphysical theory of pythagoras thales searched for simple material form directly perceptible by the senses behind the appearances of things and his theory is also related to the older animism this was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life through unnaturally simplified forms pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics and that the forms were based on transcendental mathematical relation the forms on earth are imperfect imitations eikones images of the celestial world of numbers his ideas had great influence on post archaic art the greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation that would lead to the esthetic perfection canon in classical greece anaxagoras asserted that divine reason mind gave order to the seeds of the universe and plato extended the greek belief of ideal forms to his metaphysical theory of forms ideai ideas the forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas the greek words oida know and eidos species thing seen have the same root as the word idea thing ἰδείν to see indicating how the greek mind moved from the gift of the senses to the principles beyond the senses the artists in plato time moved away from his theories and art tends to be mixture of naturalism with stylization the greek sculptors considered the senses more important and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual archaic sculpture kerameikos archaeological museum in athens kouros male youth is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the archaic period in greece this type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of apollo the first statues are certainly still and formal the formality of their stance seems to be related with the egyptian precedent but it was accepted for good reason the sculptors had clear idea of what young man is and embodied the archaic smile of good manners the firm and springy step the balance of the body dignity and youthful happiness when they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods the adoption of standard recognizable type for long time is probably because nature gives preference in survival of type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions and also due to the general greek belief that nature expresses itself in ideal forms that can be imagined and represented these forms expressed immortality apollo was the immortal god of ideal balance and order his shrine in delphi that he shared in winter with dionysius had the inscriptions gnōthi seautón know thyself and mēdén ágan nothing in excess and eggýa pára atē make pledge and mischief is nigh new york kouros met mus marble bc metropolitan museum of art in the first large scale depictions during the early archaic period bc the artists tried to draw one attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses but as being full of life the greeks maintained until late in their civilization an almost animistic idea that the statues are in some sense alive this embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself fine example is the statue of the sacred gate kouros which was found at the cemetery of dipylon in athens dipylon kouros the statue is the thing in itself and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity according to the greek tradition the dipylon master was named daedalus and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body giving the impression that the statues could move it is considered that he created also the new york kouros which is the oldest fully preserved statue of kouros type and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself piraeus apollo archaic style bronze archaeological museum of piraeus the animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality is sanctified in the homeric poems and in greek myths in stories of the god hephaestus phaistos and the mythic daedalus the builder of the labyrinth that made images which moved of their own accord this kind of art goes back to the minoan period when its main theme was the representation of motion in specific moment these free standing statues were usually marble but also the form rendered in limestone bronze ivory and terracotta the earliest examples of life sized statues of apollo may be two figures from the ionic sanctuary on the island of delos such statues were found across the greek speaking world the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of apollo ptoios boeotia alone the last stage in the development of the kouros type is the late archaic period bc in which the greek sculpture attained full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create relative harmonious whole ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze piraeus apollo it was found in piraeus the harbour of athens the statue originally held the bow in its left hand and cup of pouring libation in its right hand it probably comes from north eastern peloponnesus the emphasis is given in anatomy and it is one of the first attempts to represent kind of motion and beauty relative to proportions which appear mostly in post archaic art the statue throws some light on an artistic centre which with an independently developed harder simpler and heavier style restricts ionian influence in athens finally this is the germ from which the art of polykleitos was to grow two or three generations later classical sculpture apollo of the mantoua type marble roman copy after th century bce greek original attributed to polykleitos musée du louvre at the beginning of the classical period it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else consisted of symmetry and proportions the artists tried also to represent motion in specific moment myron which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant minoan element anatomy and geometry are fused in one and each does something to the other the greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions just as they sought some reality behind appearances polykleitos in his canon wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements materials but of the parts that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole it seems that he was influenced by the theories of pythagoras the famous apollo of mantua and its variants are early forms of the apollo citharoedus statue type in which the god holds the cithara in his left arm the type is represented by neo attic imperial roman copies of the late st or early nd century modelled upon supposed greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the th century bce in style similar to works of polykleitos but more archaic the apollo held the cythara against his extended left arm of which in the louvre example fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps though the proportions were always important in greek art the appeal of the greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone the statues of apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the minoan period and in the beliefs of the first greek speaking people who entered the region during the bronze age just as the greeks saw the mountains forests sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form and the form of work of art spiritual life is incorporated in matter when it is given artistic form just as in the arts the greeks sought some reality behind appearances so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect as to the whole sentient self things as we see them and as they really are are one that each stresses the nature of the other in single unity pediments and friezes temple of zeus olympia greece in the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples the artists had problem to fit group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base the siphnian treasury in delphi was one of the first greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling the pediment shows the story of heracles stealing apollo tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration their two figures hold the centre in the pediment of the temple of zeus in olympia the single figure of apollo is dominating the scene head of the apollo belvedere these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space but only as parts in larger whole while each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs in these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals to suggest passage to and from busy battlefield the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order and this was improved when classical art brought greater freedom and economy hellenistic greece rome apollo as handsome beardless young man is often depicted with kithara as apollo citharoedus or bow in his hand or reclining on tree the apollo lykeios and apollo sauroctonos types the apollo belvedere is marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late th century for centuries it epitomized the ideals of classical antiquity for europeans from the renaissance through the th century the marble is hellenistic or roman copy of bronze original by the greek sculptor leochares made between and bce the life size so called adonis found in on the site of villa suburbana near the via labicana in the roman suburb of centocelle is identified as an apollo by modern scholars in the late nd century ce floor mosaic from el djem roman thysdrus he is identifiable as apollo helios by his effulgent halo though now even god divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later empire another haloed apollo in mosaic from hadrumentum is in the museum at sousse the conventions of this representation head tilted lips slightly parted large eyed curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck were developed in the rd century bce to depict alexander the great some time after this mosaic was executed the earliest depictions of christ would also be beardless and haloed modern reception apollo has often featured in postclassical art and literature percy bysshe shelley composed hymn of apollo and the god instruction of the muses formed the subject of igor stravinsky apollon musagète in the canadian band rush released an album with songs apollo bringer of wisdom dionysus bringer of love in discussion of the arts distinction is sometimes made between the apollonian and dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity friedrich nietzsche argued that fusion of the two was most desirable carl jung apollo archetype represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over intellectualise and maintain emotional distance charles handy in gods of management uses greek gods as metaphor to portray various types of organisational culture apollo represents role culture where

afroasiatic afro asiatic also known as afrasian and traditionally as hamito semitic chamito semitic or semito hamitic is large language family of about languages and dialects it includes languages spoken predominantly in west asia north africa the horn of africa and parts of the sahel afroasiatic languages have over million native speakers the fourth largest number of any language family after indo european sino tibetan and niger congo the phylum has six branches berber chadic cushitic egyptian omotic and semitic by far the most widely spoken afroasiatic language is arabic language within the semitic branch it includes modern standard arabic as well as spoken colloquial varieties arabic has around million native speakers who are concentrated primarily in west asia north africa the horn of africa and malta other widely spoken afroasiatic languages include hausa chadic branch the dominant language of northern nigeria ghana and southern niger spoken as first language by over million people and used as lingua franca by another million across west africa and the sahel oromo cushitic branch spoken in ethiopia and kenya by around million people total amharic semitic branch spoken in ethiopia with over million native speakers in addition to millions of other ethiopians speaking it as second language somali cushitic branch spoken by million people in somalia djibouti eastern ethiopia and northeastern kenya hebrew semitic branch spoken by around million people in israel and worldwide tigrinya semitic branch spoken by around million people in eritrea and ethiopia kabyle berber branch spoken by around million people in algeria central atlas tamazight berber branch spoken by around million people in morocco neo aramaic languages semitic branch spoken by about people worldwide this is not just one language it includes number of subdivisions with assyrian neo aramaic being the most spoken variety in addition to languages spoken today afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages such as ancient egyptian akkadian biblical hebrew and old aramaic it is debated when and where the original homeland of the afroasiatic family existed proposed locations include north africa the horn of africa the eastern sahara and the levant etymology during the early linguists grouped the berber cushitic and egyptian languages within hamitic phylum in acknowledgement of these languages genetic relation with each other and with those in the semitic phylum the terms hamitic and semitic were etymologically derived from the book of genesis which describes various biblical tribes descended from ham and shem two sons of noah by the the main constituent elements within the broader afroasiatic family had been worked out the scholar friedrich müller introduced the name hamito semitic for the entire family in his grundriss der maurice delafosse later coined the term afroasiatic often now spelled afro asiatic however it did not come into general use until joseph greenberg formally proposed its adoption in doing so greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that afroasiatic spanned the continents of both africa and asia individual scholars have also called the family erythraean tucker and lisramic hodge in lieu of hamito semitic the russian linguist igor diakonoff later suggested the term afrasian meaning half african half asiatic in reference to the geographic distribution of the family constituent languages the term hamito semitic remains in use in the academic traditions of some european countries distribution and branches interrelations between branches of afroasiatic lipiński some linguists proposals for grouping within afroasiatic the afroasiatic language family is usually considered to include the following branches berber chadic cushitic egyptian omotic semitic although there is general agreement on these six families there are some points of disagreement among linguists who study afroasiatic in particular the omotic language branch is the most controversial member of afroasiatic because the grammatical formatives that most linguists have given greatest weight in classifying languages in the family are either absent or distinctly wobbly hayward greenberg and others considered it subgroup of cushitic whereas others have raised doubts about it being part of afroasiatic at all theil the afroasiatic identity of ongota is also broadly questioned as is its position within afroasiatic among those who accept it due to the mixed appearance of the language and paucity of research and data harold fleming proposes that ongota constitutes separate branch of afroasiatic bonny sands believes the most convincing proposal is by savà and tosco namely that ongota is an east cushitic language with nilo saharan substratum in other words it would appear that the ongota people once spoke nilo saharan language but then shifted to speaking cushitic language but retained some characteristics of their earlier nilo saharan language beja is sometimes listed as separate branch of afroasiatic but is more often included in the cushitic branch which has high degree of internal diversity whether the various branches of cushitic actually form language family is sometimes questioned but not their inclusion in afroasiatic itself there is no consensus on the of the five non omotic branches of afroasiatic see subgrouping below this situation is not unusual even among long established language families there are also many disagreements concerning the internal classification of the indo european languages for instance meroitic has been proposed as an unclassified afroasiatic language because it shares the phonotactics characteristic of the family but there is not enough evidence to secure classification classification history in the th century the hebrew grammarian judah ibn quraysh of tiaret in algeria was the first to link two branches of afroasiatic together he perceived relationship between berber and semitic he knew of semitic through his study of arabic hebrew and aramaic in the course of the th century europeans also began suggesting such relationships in theodor benfey suggested language family consisting of semitic berber and cushitic calling the latter ethiopic in the same year newman suggested relationship between semitic and hausa but this would long remain topic of dispute and uncertainty friedrich müller named the traditional hamito semitic family in in his grundriss der outline of linguistics and defined it as consisting of semitic group plus hamitic group containing egyptian berber and cushitic he excluded the chadic group it was the egyptologist karl richard lepsius who restricted hamitic to the non semitic languages in africa which are characterized by grammatical gender system this hamitic language group was proposed to unite various mainly north african languages including the ancient egyptian language the berber languages the cushitic languages the beja language and the chadic languages unlike müller lepsius considered that hausa and nama were part of the hamitic group these classifications relied in part on non linguistic anthropological and racial arguments both authors used the skin color mode of subsistence and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped together distribution of the afroasiatic hamito semitic languages in africa in carl meinhof published die sprachen der hamiten the languages of the hamites in which he expanded lepsius model adding the fula maasai bari nandi sandawe and hadza languages to the hamitic group meinhof model was widely supported into the meinhof system of classification of the hamitic languages was based on belief that speakers of hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially caucasian origins intrinsically different from and superior to the negroes of africa but in the case of the so called nilo hamitic languages concept he introduced it was based on the typological feature of gender and fallacious theory of language mixture meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as lepsius and johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub nilo hamitic were in fact nilotic languages with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other nilotic languages leo reinisch had already proposed linking cushitic and chadic while urging their more distant affinity with egyptian and semitic however his suggestion found little acceptance marcel cohen rejected the idea of distinct hamitic subgroup and included hausa chadic language in his comparative hamito semitic vocabulary finally joseph greenberg work led to the widespread rejection of hamitic as language category by linguists greenberg refuted meinhof linguistic theories and rejected the use of racial and social evidence in dismissing the notion of separate nilo hamitic language category in particular greenberg was returning to view widely held half century earlier he consequently rejoined meinhof so called nilo hamitic languages with their appropriate nilotic siblings he also added and sub classified the chadic languages and proposed the new name afroasiatic for the family almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus greenberg model was fully developed in his book the languages of africa in which he reassigned most of meinhof additions to hamitic to other language families notably nilo saharan following isaac schapera and rejecting meinhof he classified the hottentot language as member of the central khoisan languages to khoisan he also added the tanzanian hadza and sandawe though this view remains controversial since some scholars consider these languages to be linguistic isolates despite this greenberg model remains the basis for modern classifications of languages spoken in africa and the hamitic category and its extension to nilo hamitic has no part in this since the three traditional branches of the hamitic languages berber cushitic and egyptian have not been shown to form an exclusive monophyletic phylogenetic unit of their own separate from other afroasiatic languages linguists no longer use the term in this sense each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger afroasiatic family in harold fleming proposed that what had previously been known as western cushitic is an independent branch of afroasiatic suggesting for it the new name omotic this proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance several scholars including harold fleming and robert hetzron have since questioned the traditional inclusion of beja in cushitic glottolog does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of omotic has been established nor that of ongota or the unclassified kujarge it therefore splits off the following groups as small families south omotic mao dizoid gonga gimojan north omotic apart from the preceding ongota kujarge subgrouping proposed afroasiatic sub divisions greenberg newman fleming post ehret semitic egyptian

afrasian omotic cushitic little agreement exists on the subgrouping of the five or six branches of afroasiatic semitic egyptian berber chadic cushitic and omotic however christopher ehret harold fleming and joseph greenberg all agree that the omotic branch split from the rest first otherwise paul newman groups berber with chadic and egyptian with semitic while questioning the inclusion of omotic in afroasiatic rolf theil concurs with the exclusion of omotic but does not otherwise address the structure of the family harold fleming divides non omotic afroasiatic or erythraean into three groups cushitic semitic and chadic berber egyptian he later added semitic and beja to chadic berber egyptian and tentatively proposed ongota as new third branch of erythraean he thus divided afroasiatic into two major branches omotic and erythraean with erythraean consisting of three sub branches cushitic chadic berber egyptian semitic beja and ongota like harold fleming christopher ehret divides afroasiatic into two branches omotic and erythrean he divides omotic into two branches north omotic and south omotic he divides erythrean into cushitic comprising beja agaw and east south cushitic and north erythrean comprising chadic and boreafrasian according to his classification boreafrasian consists of egyptian berber and semitic vladimir orel and olga stolbova group berber with semitic and chadic with egyptian they split up cushitic into five or more independent branches of afroasiatic viewing cushitic as sprachbund rather than language family igor diakonoff subdivides afroasiatic in two grouping berber cushitic and semitic together as east west afrasian esa and chadic with egyptian as north south afrasian nsa he excludes omotic from afroasiatic lionel bender groups berber cushitic and semitic together as macro cushitic he regards chadic and omotic as the branches of afroasiatic most remote from the others alexander militarev on the basis of groups berber with chadic and both more distantly with semitic as against cushitic and omotic he places ongota in south omotic position among the world languages afroasiatic is one of the four major language families spoken in africa identified by joseph greenberg in his book the languages of africa it is one of the few whose speech area is with languages from afroasiatic semitic branch also spoken in the middle east and europe there are no generally accepted relations between afroasiatic and any other language family however several proposals grouping afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made the best known of these are the following hermann möller argued for relation between semitic and the indo european languages this proposal was accepted by few linguists holger pedersen and louis hjelmslev for fuller account see indo semitic languages however the theory has little currency today although most linguists do not deny the existence of grammatical similarities between both families such as grammatical gender noun adjective agreement three way number distinction and vowel alternation as means of derivation apparently influenced by möller colleague of his at the university of copenhagen holger pedersen included hamito semitic the term replaced by afroasiatic in his proposed nostratic macro family cf pedersen also included the indo european uralic altaic yukaghir languages and dravidian languages this inclusion was retained by subsequent nostraticists starting with vladislav illich svitych and aharon dolgopolsky joseph greenberg did not reject relationship of afroasiatic to these other languages but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other grouping instead these other languages in separate macro family which he called eurasiatic and to which he added chukotian gilyak korean japanese ryukyuan eskimo aleut and ainu most recently sergei starostin school has accepted eurasiatic as subgroup of nostratic with afroasiatic dravidian and kartvelian in nostratic outside of eurasiatic the even larger borean super family contains nostratic as well as dené caucasian and austric date of afroasiatic neo aramaic language descendant of old aramaic the earliest written evidence of an afroasiatic language is an ancient egyptian inscription dated to bc years ago symbols on gerzean naqada ii pottery resembling egyptian hieroglyphs date back to bc suggesting an earlier possible dating this gives us minimum date for the age of afroasiatic however ancient egyptian is highly divergent from proto afroasiatic trombetti and considerable time must have elapsed in between them estimates of the date at which the proto afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely they fall within range between approximately bc years ago and approximately bc years ago according to igor diakonoff proto afroasiatic was spoken bc christopher ehret asserts that proto afroasiatic was spoken bc at the latest and possibly as early as bc these dates are older than those associated with other proto languages afroasiatic urheimat map showing one of the proposed afroasiatic urheimat the term afroasiatic urheimat urheimat meaning original homeland in german refers to the hypothetical place where proto afroasiatic language speakers lived in single linguistic community or complex of communities before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in west asia north africa the horn of africa and parts of the sahel their distribution seems to have been influenced by the sahara pump operating over the last years there is no agreement when or where the original homeland of this language family existed proposed

amphibians are ectothermic tetrapod vertebrates of the class amphibia modern amphibians are all lissamphibia they inhabit wide variety of habitats with most species living within terrestrial fossorial arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this the young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air breathing form with lungs amphibians use their skin as secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin they are superficially similar to lizards but along with mammals and birds reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often ecological indicators in recent decades there has been dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe the earliest amphibians evolved in the devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony limbed fins features that were helpful in adapting to dry land they diversified and became dominant during the carboniferous and permian periods but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates over time amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity leaving only the modern subclass lissamphibia the three modern orders of amphibians are anura the frogs and toads urodela the salamanders and apoda the caecilians the number of known amphibian species is approximately of which nearly are frogs the smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is frog from new guinea paedophryne amauensis with length of just the largest living amphibian is the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus but this is dwarfed by the extinct prionosuchus from the middle permian of brazil the study of amphibians is called batrachology while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology classification the world smallest known vertebrate paedophryne amauensis sitting on dime which is mm in diameter for scale the word amphibian is derived from the ancient greek term ἀμφίβιος amphíbios which means both kinds of life ἀμφί meaning of both kinds and βιος meaning life the term was initially used as general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water including seals and otters traditionally the class amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes amphibia in its widest sense sensu lato was divided into three subclasses two of which are extinct subclass lepospondyli small paleozoic group which may actually be more closely related to amniotes than lissamphibia subclass temnospondyli diverse paleozoic and early mesozoic grade subclass lissamphibia all modern amphibians including frogs toads salamanders newts and caecilians salientia frogs toads and relatives jurassic to present current species in families caudata salamanders newts and relatives jurassic to present current species in families gymnophiona caecilians and relatives jurassic to present current species in families triadobatrachus massinoti proto frog from the early triassic of madagascar the actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed the two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website amphibiaweb university of california berkeley and the classification by herpetologist darrel frost and the american museum of natural history available as the online reference database amphibian species of the world the numbers of species cited above follows frost and the total number of known amphibian species is over of which nearly are frogs with the phylogenetic classification the taxon has been discarded as it is group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use stem based or node based classification traditionally amphibians as class are defined as all tetrapods with larval stage while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians frogs salamanders and caecilians and all their descendants is called lissamphibia the phylogeny of paleozoic amphibians is uncertain and lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups like the temnospondyli traditionally placed in the subclass or the lepospondyli and in some analyses even in the amniotes this means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed large number of basal devonian and carboniferous amphibian type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in amphibia in linnaean taxonomy and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy if the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in amphibia it becomes paraphyletic group all modern amphibians are included in the subclass lissamphibia which is usually considered clade group of species that have evolved from common ancestor the three modern orders are anura the frogs and toads caudata or urodela the salamanders and gymnophiona or apoda the caecilians it has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from temnospondyl like ancestor and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced reptiliomorph amphibians and thus of amniotes although the fossils of several older proto frogs with primitive characteristics are known the oldest true frog is prosalirus bitis from the early jurassic kayenta formation of arizona it is anatomically very similar to modern frogs the oldest known caecilian is another early jurassic species eocaecilia micropodia also from arizona the earliest salamander is beiyanerpeton jianpingensis from the late jurassic of northeastern china authorities disagree as to whether salientia is superorder that includes the order anura or whether anura is sub order of the order salientia the lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders but an extinct salamander like family the is now considered part of lissamphibia alongside the superorder salientia furthermore salientia includes all three recent orders plus the triassic proto frog triadobatrachus evolutionary history the first major groups of amphibians developed in the devonian period around million years ago from lobe finned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish these ancient lobe finned fish had evolved multi jointed leg like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the devonian swamps were low in oxygen they could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required eventually their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods including modern amphibians reptiles birds and mammals despite being able to crawl on land many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water they had started to develop lungs but still breathed predominantly with gills many examples of species showing transitional features have been discovered ichthyostega was one of the first primitive amphibians with nostrils and more efficient lungs it had four sturdy limbs neck tail with fins and skull very similar to that of the lobe finned fish eusthenopteron amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger better able to support the weight of their bodies on land they developed hands and feet with five or more digits the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation the fish hyomandibula bone in the hyoid region behind the gills diminished in size and became the stapes of the amphibian ear an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land an affinity between the amphibians and the teleost fish is the multi folded structure of the teeth and the paired supra occipital bones at the back of the head neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom the permian lepospondyl diplocaulus was largely aquatic at the end of the devonian period million years ago the seas rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates though some such as ichthyostega may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water it is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs dragging their hindquarters in similar manner to that used by the elephant seal in the early carboniferous to million years ago the climate became wet and warm extensive swamps developed with mosses ferns horsetails and calamites air breathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment there were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air most still had long tapering body and strong tail they were the top land predators sometimes reaching several metres in length preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water they still needed to return to water to lay their shell less eggs and even most modern amphibians have fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors it was the development of the amniotic egg which prevents the developing embryo from drying out that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed after the carboniferous rainforest collapse amphibian dominance gave way to reptiles and amphibians were further devastated by the permian triassic extinction event during the triassic period to million years ago the reptiles continued to out compete the amphibians leading to reduction in both the amphibians size and their importance in the biosphere according to the fossil record lissamphibia which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage may have branched off from the extinct groups temnospondyli and lepospondyli at some period between the late carboniferous and the early triassic the relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating but the most recent molecular study based on multilocus sequence typing suggests late carboniferous early permian origin for extant amphibians the temnospondyl eryops had sturdy limbs to support its body on land the origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is matter of debate molecular phylogeny based on rdna analysis suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs it also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the paleozoic or early mesozoic around million years ago before the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe finned fish the briefness of this period and the swiftness with which radiation took place would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils there are large gaps in the fossil record but the discovery of gerobatrachus hottoni from the early permian in texas in provided missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs molecular analysis suggests that the frog salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the evidence indicates newer research indicates that the common ancestor of all lissamphibians lived about million years ago and that stereospondyls are the closest relatives to the caecilians as they evolved from lunged fish amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land including the need to develop new means of locomotion in the water the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward but on land quite different mechanisms were required their vertebral columns limbs limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air they needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature they developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in terrestrial environment their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water the skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss characteristics the superclass tetrapoda is divided into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs reptiles birds and mammals are amniotes the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes some of which are impervious lacking these membranes amphibians require water bodies for reproduction although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage they are not found in the sea with the exception of one or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps on land amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp the smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is microhylid frog from new guinea paedophryne amauensis first discovered in it has an average length of and is part of genus that contains four of the world ten smallest frog species the largest living amphibian is the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus but this is great deal smaller than the largest amphibian that ever existed the extinct prionosuchus crocodile like temnospondyl dating to million years ago from the middle permian of brazil the largest frog is the african goliath frog conraua goliath which can reach and weigh amphibians are ectothermic cold blooded vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal physiological processes their metabolic rate is low and as result their food and energy requirements are limited in the adult state they have tear ducts and movable eyelids and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations they have muscular tongues which in many species can be protruded modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae their skulls are mostly broad and short and are often incompletely ossified their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales apart from few fish like scales in certain caecilians the skin contains many mucous glands and in some species poison glands type of granular gland the hearts of amphibians have three chambers two atria and one ventricle they have urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults amphibians breathe by means of pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin anura red eyed tree frog agalychnis callidryas with limbs and feet specialised for climbing the order anura from the ancient greek meaning without and oura meaning tail comprises the frogs and toads they usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them shorter forelimbs webbed toes with no claws no tails large eyes and glandular moist skin members of this order with smooth skins are commonly referred to as frogs while those with warty skins are known as toads the difference is not formal one taxonomically and there are numerous exceptions to this rule members of the family bufonidae are known as the true toads frogs range in size from the goliath frog conraua goliath of west africa to the paedophryne amauensis first described in papua new guinea in which is also the smallest known vertebrate although most species are associated with water and damp habitats some are specialised to live in trees or in deserts they are found worldwide except for polar areas anura is divided into three suborders that are broadly accepted by the scientific community but the relationships between some families remain unclear future molecular studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships the suborder contains four families of primitive frogs these are ascaphidae bombinatoridae discoglossidae and leiopelmatidae which have few derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages the six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder mesobatrachia are the fossorial megophryidae pelobatidae pelodytidae scaphiopodidae and rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic pipidae these have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders neobatrachia is by far the largest suborder and includes the remaining families of modern frogs including most common species ninety six percent of the over extant species of frog are neobatrachians caudata japanese giant salamander andrias japonicus primitive salamander the order caudata from the latin cauda meaning tail consists of the salamanders elongated low slung animals that mostly resemble lizards in form this is trait and they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals salamanders lack claws have scale free skins either smooth or covered with tubercles and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned they range in size from the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus which has been reported to grow to length of to the diminutive thorius pennatulus from mexico which seldom exceeds in length salamanders have mostly laurasian distribution being present in much of the holarctic region of the northern hemisphere the family plethodontidae is also found in central america and south america north of the amazon basin south america was apparently invaded from central america by about the start of the miocene million years ago urodela is name sometimes used for all the extant species of salamanders members of several salamander families have become paedomorphic and either fail to complete their metamorphosis or retain some larval characteristics as adults most salamanders are under long they may be terrestrial or aquatic and many spend part of the year in each habitat when on land they mostly spend the day hidden under stones or logs or in dense vegetation emerging in the evening and night to forage for worms insects and other invertebrates danube crested newt triturus dobrogicus an advanced salamander the suborder contains the primitive salamanders number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found but there are only three living species the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus the japanese giant salamander andrias japonicus and the hellbender cryptobranchus alleganiensis from north america these large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded unique feature is their ability to feed by suction depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right the males excavate nests persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them and guard them as well as breathing with lungs they respire through the many folds in their thin skin which has capillaries close to the surface the suborder salamandroidea contains the advanced salamanders they differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused prearticular bones in the lower jaw and by using internal fertilisation in salamandrids the male deposits bundle of sperm the spermatophore and the female picks it up and inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid the largest family in this group is plethodontidae the lungless salamanders which includes of all salamander species the family salamandridae includes the true salamanders and the name newt is given to members of its subfamily pleurodelinae the third suborder sirenoidea contains the four species of sirens which are in single family sirenidae members of this order are eel like aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs some of their features are primitive while others are derived fertilisation is likely to be external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecae for sperm storage despite this the eggs are laid singly behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation gymnophiona the limbless south american caecilian siphonops paulensis the order gymnophiona from the greek gymnos meaning naked and ophis meaning serpent or apoda from the latin an meaning without and the greek poda meaning legs comprises the caecilians these are long cylindrical limbless animals with snake or worm like form the adults vary in length from to centimetres to inches with the exception of thomson caecilian caecilia thompsoni which can reach caecilian skin has large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales it has rudimentary eyes covered in skin which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity it also has pair of short tentacles near the eye that can be extended and which have tactile and olfactory functions most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp soil in rotten wood and under plant debris but some are aquatic most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch they make their way to adjacent bodies of water others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch few species give birth to live young nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct caecilians have mostly gondwanan distribution being found in tropical regions of africa asia and central and south america anatomy and physiology skin bright colours of the common reed frog hyperolius viridiflavus are typical of toxic species the integumentary structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates such as the presence of highly cornified outer layers renewed periodically through moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands local thickenings often called warts are common such as those found on toads the outside of the skin is shed periodically mostly in one piece in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes amphibians often eat the sloughed skin caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin the similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony deposits in the dermis but this is an example of convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages cross section of frog skin mucus gland chromatophore granular poison gland connective tissue stratum corneum transition zone epidermis dermis amphibian skin is permeable to water gas exchange can take place through the skin cutaneous respiration and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds to compensate for their thin and delicate skin amphibians have evolved mucous glands principally on their heads backs and tails the secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist in addition most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect the main poison producing glands the paratoids produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads along the backs of frogs behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians the skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores these three cell layers consist of the melanophores occupying the deepest layer the guanophores forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules producing blue green colour and the lipophores yellow the most superficial layer the colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland unlike bony fish there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is warning sign to predators skeletal system and locomotion amphibians have skeletal system that is structurally homologous to other tetrapods though with number of variations they all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs the bones are hollow and lightweight the musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body the bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes the pectoral girdle is supported by muscle and the well developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by pair of sacral ribs the ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals skeleton of the surinam horned frog ceratophrys cornuta in most amphibians there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot but no claws on either some salamanders have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel like in appearance with tiny stubby legs the sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs the caecilians are limbless they burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body on the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side in frogs the hind legs are larger than the fore legs especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming in the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies the feet have adaptations for the way of life with webbing between the toes for swimming broad adhesive toe pads for climbing and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging frogs usually dig backwards into the soil in most salamanders the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as prop particularly when climbing in their normal gait only one leg is advanced at time in the manner adopted by their ancestors the lobe finned fish some salamanders in the genus aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs large toepads and prehensile tails in aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as means of propulsion adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones salamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in process known as autotomy certain species in the plethodontidae have weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily the tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape both tails and limbs can be regenerated adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so circulatory system didactic model of an amphibian heart juvenile amphibian circulatory systems are single loop systems which resemble fish internal gills where the blood is reoxygenated point where the blood is depleted of oxygen and returns to the heart via veins two chambered heart red indicates oxygenated blood and blue represents oxygen depleted blood amphibians have juvenile stage and an adult stage and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct in the juvenile or tadpole stage the circulation is similar to that of fish the two chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated and is spread around the body and back to the heart in single loop in the adult stage amphibians especially frogs lose their gills and develop lungs they have heart that consists of single ventricle and two atria when the ventricle starts contracting deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers nervous and sensory systems the nervous system is basically the same as in other vertebrates with central brain spinal cord and nerves throughout the body the amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of fish it is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving pain the brain consists of equal parts cerebrum midbrain and cerebellum various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning the cerebellum is the center of muscular coordination and the medulla oblongata controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration the brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the body the pineal body known to regulate sleep patterns in humans is thought to produce the hormones involved in hibernation and aestivation in amphibians tadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians some caecilians possess that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water the ears are well developed in frogs there is no external ear but the large circular eardrum lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye this vibrates and sound is transmitted through single bone the stapes to the inner ear only high frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way but low frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism there is patch of specialized haircells called papilla amphibiorum in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds another feature unique to frogs and salamanders is the columella operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals the ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound the eyes of tadpoles lack lids but at metamorphosis the cornea becomes more dome shaped the lens becomes flatter and eyelids and associated glands and ducts develop the adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes they allow colour vision and depth of focus in the retinas are green rods which are receptive to wide range of wavelengths digestive and excretory systems dissected frog right atrium liver aorta egg mass colon left atrium ventricle stomach left lung gallbladder small intestine cloaca many amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs the short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage the enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey amphibians possess pancreas liver and gall bladder the liver is usually large with two lobes its size is determined by its function as glycogen and fat storage unit and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen in internal structures called fat bodies under the skin and in some salamanders in the tail there are two kidneys located dorsally near the roof of the body cavity their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine while terrestrial species with greater need to conserve water excrete the less toxic product urea some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid respiratory system the axolotl ambystoma mexicanum retains its larval form with gills into adulthood the lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes possessing few internal septa and large alveoli and consequently having comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping most amphibians however are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin to enable sufficient cutaneous respiration the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at sufficiently high rate because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration as in the titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander in air where oxygen is more concentrated some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange most famously the plethodontid salamanders which have neither lungs nor gills many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage with some such as the axolotl retaining gills as aquatic adults reproduction male orange thighed frog litoria xanthomera grasping the female during amplexus for the purpose of reproduction most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist few fejervarya raja can inhabit brackish water but there are no true marine amphibians there are reports however of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters such was the case with the black sea invasion of the natural hybrid pelophylax esculentus reported in several hundred frog species in adaptive radiations the pacific platymantis the australo papuan microhylids and many other tropical frogs however do not need any water for breeding in the wild they reproduce via direct development an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free standing water almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult passing through the tadpole stage within the egg reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall but the seasonal timing in the tropics many amphibians breed continuously or at any time of year in temperate regions breeding is mostly seasonal usually in the spring and is triggered by increasing day length rising temperatures or rainfall experiments have shown the importance of temperature but the trigger event especially in arid regions is often storm in anurans males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active in caecilians fertilisation is internal the male extruding an intromittent organ the phallodeum and inserting it into the female cloaca the paired müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian prostate glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct the majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation in most of these the male deposits spermatophore small packet of sperm on top of gelatinous cone on the substrate either on land or in the water the female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent the spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species in some the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus certain primitive salamanders in the families sirenidae hynobiidae and practice external fertilisation in similar manner to frogs with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass with few exceptions frogs use external fertilisation the male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs or in the case of epipedobates tricolor around the neck they remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm roughened nuptial pads on the male hands aid in retaining grip often the male collects and retains the egg mass forming sort of basket with the hind feet an exception is the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously the tailed frog ascaphus truei exhibits internal fertilisation the tail is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female this frog lives in fast flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs the sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the oviduct until the following spring most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders typically prolonged breeders congregate at breeding site the males usually arriving first calling and setting up territories other satellite males remain quietly nearby waiting for their opportunity to take over territory the females arrive sporadically mate selection takes place and eggs are laid the females depart and territories may change hands more females appear and in due course the breeding season comes to an end explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall these frogs are typically fossorial species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at breeding site they are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find suitable place perhaps pool that forms in the same place each rainy season the assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females sexual selection has been studied in the red back salamander there is direct competition between males to win the attention of the females in salamanders and newts with elaborate courtship displays to keep the female attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him to mate with some species store sperm through long breeding seasons as the extra time may allow for interactions with rival sperm life cycle most amphibians go through metamorphosis process of significant morphological change after birth in typical amphibian development eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle frogs toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood which stimulates metamorphosis and prolactin which counteracts thyroxine effect specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues because most embryonic development is outside the parental body it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances for this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth whisker like skin extensions or fins they also make use of sensory lateral line organ similar to that of fish after metamorphosis these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death called apoptosis the variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide with many discoveries still being made eggs frogspawn mass of eggs surrounded by jelly amphibian egg jelly capsule vitelline membrane perivitelline fluid yolk plug embryo the egg of an amphibian is typically surrounded by transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing mucoproteins and this capsule is permeable to water and gases and swells considerably as it absorbs water the ovum is at first rigidly held but in fertilised eggs the innermost layer liquefies and allows the embryo to move freely this also happens in salamander eggs even when they are unfertilised eggs of some salamanders and frogs contain unicellular green algae these penetrate the jelly envelope after the eggs are laid and may increase the supply of oxygen to the embryo through photosynthesis they seem to both speed up the development of the larvae and reduce mortality most eggs contain the pigment melanin which raises their temperature through the absorption of light and also protects them against ultraviolet radiation caecilians some plethodontid salamanders and certain frogs lay eggs underground that are unpigmented in the wood frog rana sylvatica the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to warmer than its surroundings which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat the eggs may be deposited singly or in small groups or may take the form of spherical egg masses rafts or long strings in terrestrial caecilians the eggs are laid in grape like clusters in burrows near streams the amphibious salamander ensatina attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots the greenhouse frog planirostris lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage the tungara frog physalaemus pustulosus builds floating nest from foam to protect its eggs first raft is built then eggs are laid in the centre and finally foam cap is overlaid the foam has anti microbial properties it contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectins secreted by the female larvae early stages in the development of the embryos of the common frog rana temporaria the eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into free living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults in many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders plethodontidae direct development takes place the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies some caecilians the alpine salamander salamandra atra and some of the african live bearing toads nectophrynoides spp are viviparous their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female oviduct often for long periods other amphibians but not caecilians are ovoviviparous the eggs are retained in or on the parent body but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult the larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth either before or after metamorphosis according to their species the toad genus nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members frogs frog larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and long vertically flattened tails with fins the free living larvae are normally fully aquatic but the tadpoles of some species such as nannophrys ceylonensis are semi terrestrial and live among wet rocks tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons gills for respiration external gills at first internal gills later lateral line systems and large tails that they use for swimming newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills the lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs these larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place while tadpoles do not have true teeth in most species the jaws have long parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by horny beak front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible few days later amphibian metamorphosis iodine and over stimulate the spectacular apoptosis programmed cell death of the cells of the larval gills tail and fins also stimulate the evolution of nervous systems transforming the aquatic vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial carnivorous frog with better neurological visuospatial olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting in fact tadpoles developing in ponds and streams are typically herbivorous pond tadpoles tend to have deep bodies large caudal fins and small mouths they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths shallow bodies and caudal fins they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria they also feed on diatoms filtered from the water through the gills and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond ingesting edible fragments they have relatively long spiral shaped gut to enable them to digest this diet some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage eating insects smaller tadpoles and fish young of the cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis can occasionally be cannibalistic the younger tadpoles attacking larger more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis at metamorphosis rapid changes in the body take place as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely the spiral shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut the animal develops large jaw and its gills disappear along with its gill sac eyes and legs grow quickly and tongue is formed there are associated changes in the neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system all this can happen in about day few days later the tail is reabsorbed due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place salamanders larva of the long toed salamander ambystoma macrodactylum larvae of the alpine newt ichthyosaura alpestris at hatching typical salamander larva has eyes without lids teeth in both upper and lower jaws three pairs of feathery external gills somewhat laterally flattened body and long tail with dorsal and ventral fins the forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water pond type larvae often have pair of balancers rod like structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment some members of the genera ambystoma and dicamptodon have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form but this varies with species and with populations the northwestern salamander ambystoma gracile is one of these and depending on environmental factors either remains permanently in the larval state condition known as neoteny or transforms into an adult both of these are able to breed neoteny occurs when the animal growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food lack of trace elements and competition from conspecifics the tiger salamander ambystoma tigrinum also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process the adult tiger salamander is terrestrial but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state when conditions are particularly inhospitable on land larval breeding may allow continuation of population that would otherwise die out there are fifteen species of obligate neotenic salamanders including species of necturus proteus and amphiuma and many examples of facultative ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances lungless salamanders in the family plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay small number of unpigmented eggs in cluster among damp leaf litter each egg has large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg emerging fully formed as juvenile salamander the female salamander often broods the eggs in the genus ensatinas the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them effectively massaging them with mucous secretion in newts and salamanders metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs this is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems their lungs are functional early but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins the closure of gill slits thickening of the skin the development of eyelids and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer and land phase in winter for adaptation to water phase prolactin is the required hormone and for adaptation to the land phase thyroxine external gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time caecilians the caecilian ichthyophis glutinosus with eggs and developing embryo most terrestrial caecilians that lay eggs do so in burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water the development of the young of ichthyophis glutinosus species from sri lanka has been much studied the eel like larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water they have three pairs of external red feathery gills blunt head with two rudimentary eyes lateral line system and short tail with fins they swim by undulating their body from side to side they are mostly active at night soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land metamorphosis is gradual by the age of about ten months they have developed pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes lateral line systems and tails the skin thickens embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments by this time the caecilian has constructed burrow and is living on land ringed caecilian siphonops annulatus resembles an earthworm in the majority of species of caecilians the young are produced by vivipary typhlonectes compressicauda species from south america is typical of these up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time they are elongated and have paired sac like gills small eyes and specialised scraping teeth at first they feed on the yolks of the eggs but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct this stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall they may increase their length sixfold and be two fifths as long as their mother before being born by this time they have undergone metamorphosis lost their eyes and gills developed thicker skin and mouth tentacles and reabsorbed their teeth permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth the ringed caecilian siphonops annulatus has developed unique adaptation for the purposes of reproduction the progeny feed on skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy the brood feed as batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate meanwhile they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca parental care male common rocket frog colostethus panamensis carrying tadpoles on his back the care of offspring among amphibians has been little studied but in general the larger the number of eggs in batch the less likely it is that any degree of parental care takes place nevertheless it is estimated that in up to of amphibian species one or both adults play some role in the care of the young those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young many woodland salamanders lay clutches of eggs under dead logs or stones on land the black mountain salamander desmognathus welteri does this the mother brooding the eggs and guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs when fully developed they break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders the male hellbender primitive salamander excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there the male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen male common midwife toad alytes obstetricans carrying eggs the male colostethus subpunctatus tiny frog protects the egg cluster which is hidden under stone or log when the eggs hatch the male transports the tadpoles on his back stuck there by mucous secretion to temporary pool where he dips himself into the water and the tadpoles drop off the male midwife toad alytes obstetricans winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks he keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch he visits pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles the female gastric brooding frog rheobatrachus spp reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings however this stage was never observed before the species became extinct the tadpoles secrete hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply the pouched frog assa darlingtoni lays eggs on the ground when they hatch the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs the aquatic surinam toad pipa pipa raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera is typical of number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family dendrobatidae its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to suitable water filled crevice such as the axil of leaf or the rosette of bromeliad the female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles feeding and diet northwestern salamander ambystoma gracile eating worm with few exceptions adult amphibians are predators feeding on virtually anything that moves that they can swallow the diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles caterpillars earthworms and spiders the sirens siren spp often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed and brazilian tree frog xenohyla truncata includes large quantity of fruit in its diet the mexican burrowing toad rhinophrynus dorsalis has specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites it projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first their tongues being hinged at the front food is mostly selected by sight even in conditions of dim light movement of the prey triggers feeding response frogs have been caught on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs rana clamitans have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past toads salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey this response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves cave dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell even in complete darkness amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it lightly first to subdue it they typically have small hinged pedicellate teeth feature unique to amphibians the base and crown of these are composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals salamanders caecilians and some frogs have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws but some frogs rana spp lack teeth in the lower jaw and toads bufo spp have no teeth in many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to facial bone in the roof of the mouth edible frog pelophylax esculentus exhibiting cannibalism the tiger salamander ambystoma tigrinum is typical of the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates others amphibians such as the bufo spp toads actively search for prey while the argentine horned frog ceratophrys ornata lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes among leaf litter frogs in panama frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim often brightly coloured and toxic while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well camouflaged caecilians do not flick their tongues but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward pointing teeth the struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow the subdued prey is gulped down whole when they are newly hatched frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg when this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria algal crusts detritus and raspings from submerged plants water is drawn in through their mouths which are usually at the bottom of their heads and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out others have specialised mouthparts consisting of horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth they scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths some such as the spadefoot toads have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic vocalization male treefrog dendropsophus microcephalus inflating his air sac as he calls the calls made by caecilians and salamanders are limited to occasional soft squeaks grunts or hisses and have not been much studied clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be means of orientation as in bats or form of communication most salamanders are considered voiceless but the california giant salamander dicamptodon ensatus has vocal cords and can produce rattling or barking sound some species of salamander emit quiet squeak or yelp if attacked american toad anaxyrus americanus singing frogs are much more vocal especially during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates the presence of particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by fleeting glimpse of the animal itself in most species the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or at the corner of the mouth this may distend like balloon and acts as resonator helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere or the water at times when the animal is submerged the main vocalisation is the male loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory this call is modified to quieter courtship call on the approach of female or to more aggressive version if male intruder draws near calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy other calls include those given by female in response to the advertisement call and release call given by male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus when frog is attacked distress or fright call is emitted often resembling scream the usually nocturnal cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis produces rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours territorial behaviour little is known of the territorial behaviour of caecilians but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges these are usually feeding breeding or sheltering sites males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species females and even juveniles are also involved although in many frog species females are larger than males this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest arms or thumbs the red back salamander plethodon cinereus defends territory against intruders in salamanders defence of territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder this may involve snapping chasing and sometimes biting occasionally causing the loss of tail the behaviour of red back salamanders plethodon cinereus has been much studied of marked individuals that were later recaptured were within metre yard of their original daytime retreat under log or rock similar proportion when moved experimentally distance of found their way back to their home base the salamanders left odour marks around their territories which averaged in size and were sometimes inhabited by male and female pair these deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals an aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively if the intruder persisted biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the naso labial grooves damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food in frogs male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates in general deeper voice represents heavier and more powerful individual and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by fitter rival if he tires there is tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders holders of territories have home advantage and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar sized frogs if threats are insufficient chest to chest tussles may take place fighting methods include pushing and shoving deflating the opponent vocal sac seizing him by the head jumping on his back biting chasing splashing and ducking him under the water defence mechanisms cane toad rhinella marina with poison glands behind the eyes amphibians have soft bodies with thin skins and lack claws defensive armour or spines nevertheless they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive the first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce this keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip the secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow african clawed frogs xenopus laevis which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape caecilians have been little studied in this respect but the cayenne caecilian typhlonectes compressicauda produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in feeding experiment in brazil in some salamanders the skin is poisonous the rough skinned newt taricha granulosa from north america and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin ttx the most toxic non protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish handling the newts does not cause harm but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly in feeding trials fish frogs reptiles birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible the only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis in locations where both snake and salamander co exist the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they feed on the amphibians with impunity coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities at the same rate as the snake further develops its immunity some frogs and toads are toxic the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back these regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms altogether over toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated the fire salamander salamandra salamandra toxic species wears warning colours perhaps the most poisonous animal in the world the golden poison frog phyllobates terribilis is endemic to colombia poisonous species often use bright colouring to warn potential predators of their toxicity these warning colours tend to be red or yellow combined with black with the fire salamander salamandra salamandra being an example once predator has sampled one of these it is likely to remember the colouration next time it encounters similar animal in some species such as the fire bellied toad bombina spp the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt defensive pose when attacked exhibiting their bright colours to the predator the frog allobates zaparo is not poisonous but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality strategy that may deceive predators many amphibians are nocturnal and hide during the day thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight other amphibians use camouflage to avoid being detected they have various colourings such as mottled browns greys and olives to blend into the background some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by potential predator such as the north american northern short tailed shrew blarina brevicauda their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which makes it difficult for the predator to avoid contact with their poison producing granular glands few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape the tail may have constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached the tail is regenerated later but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant some frogs and toads inflate themselves to make themselves look large and fierce and some spadefoot toads pelobates spp scream and leap towards the attacker giant salamanders of the genus andrias as well as ceratophrine and pyxicephalus frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with defensive bite the blackbelly salamander desmognathus quadramaculatus can bite an attacking common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis two or three times its size on the head and often manages to escape cognition in amphibians there is evidence of habituation associative learning through both classical and instrumental learning and discrimination abilities in one experiment when offered live fruit flies drosophila virilis salamanders choose the larger of vs and vs frogs can distinguish between low numbers vs vs but not vs and large numbers vs vs but not vs of prey this is irrespective of other characteristics surface area volume weight and movement although discrimination among large numbers may be based on surface area conservation the extinct golden toad bufo periglenes last seen in dramatic declines in amphibian populations including population crashes and mass localized extinction have been noted since the late from locations all over the world and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity in the international union for conservation of nature iucn reported stating that currently birds mammals and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum times greater than natural extinction rates possibly times higher in there were believed to be species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle of these were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status number of causes are believed to be involved including habitat destruction and modification over exploitation pollution introduced species climate change endocrine disrupting pollutants destruction of the ozone layer ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin eyes and eggs of amphibians and diseases like however many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood and are topic of ongoing discussion the hula painted frog discoglossus nigriventer was believed to be extinct but was rediscovered in with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often considered to be ecological indicators in many terrestrial ecosystems they constitute one of the largest parts of the vertebrate biomass any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation the loss of carnivorous species near the top of the food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species in the middle east growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in mosquitoes predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline the western terrestrial garter snake thamnophis elegans in california is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are decreasing in numbers the yosemite toad bufo canorus and the mountain yellow legged frog rana muscosa putting the snake future at risk if the snake were to become scarce this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it meanwhile in the ponds and lakes fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles these normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences global strategy to stem the crisis was released in in the form of the amphibian conservation action plan developed by over eighty leading experts in the field this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost the amphibian specialist group of the iucn is spearheading efforts to implement comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation amphibian ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex situ conservation recommendations of this plan and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians one such project is the panama amphibian rescue and conservation project that built on existing conservation efforts in panama to create country wide response to the threat of see also list

was rejected on health grounds being half blind in one eye his eyesight later partly recovered in he edited oxford poetry and in june of that year graduated ba with first class honours his brother julian wrote following his years at balliol huxley being financially indebted to his father decided to find employment from april to july he was in charge of ordering supplies at the air ministry he taught french for year at eton where eric blair who was to take the pen name george orwell and steven runciman were among his pupils he was mainly remembered as being an incompetent schoolmaster unable to keep order in class nevertheless blair and others spoke highly of his brilliant command of language significantly huxley also worked for time during the at brunner and mond high tech chemical plant in billingham in county durham northeast england according to the introduction to the latest edition of his great science fiction novel brave new world the experience he had there of an ordered universe in world of planless incoherence was an important source for the novel career huxley completed his first unpublished novel at the age of and began writing seriously in his early establishing himself as successful writer and social satirist his first published novels were social satires crome yellow antic hay those barren leaves and point counter point brave new world was huxley fifth novel and first dystopian work in the he was also contributor to vanity fair and british vogue magazines bloomsbury set left to right bloomsbury group members lady ottoline morrell maria nys lytton strachey duncan grant and vanessa bell during world war huxley spent much of his time at garsington manor near oxford home of lady ottoline morrell working as farm labourer there he met several bloomsbury figures including bertrand russell alfred north whitehead and clive bell later in crome yellow he caricatured the garsington lifestyle jobs were very scarce but in john middleton murry was reorganising the athenaeum and invited huxley to join the staff he accepted immediately and quickly married the belgian refugee maria nys also at garsington they lived with their young son in italy part of the time during the where huxley would visit his friend lawrence following lawrence death in huxley edited lawrence letters works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress most famously brave new world and on pacifist themes for example eyeless in gaza in brave new world set in dystopian london huxley portrays society operating on the principles of mass production and pavlovian conditioning huxley was strongly influenced by matthias alexander and included him as character in eyeless in gaza starting from this period huxley began to write and edit non fiction works on pacifist issues including ends and means an encyclopedia of pacifism and pacifism and philosophy and was an active member of the peace pledge union united states in huxley moved to hollywood with his wife maria son matthew huxley and friend gerald heard he lived in the us mainly in southern california until his death but also for time in taos new mexico where he wrote ends and means published in the book contains tracts on war religion nationalism and ethics heard introduced huxley to vedanta upanishad centered philosophy meditation and vegetarianism through the principle of ahimsa in huxley befriended jiddu krishnamurti whose teachings he greatly admired he also became vedantist in the circle of hindu swami prabhavananda and introduced christopher isherwood to this circle not long after huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas the perennial philosophy which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world huxley book affirmed sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted five senses and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and huxley became close friend of remsen bird president of occidental college he spent much time at the college which is in the eagle rock neighbourhood of los angeles the college appears as tarzana college in his satirical novel after many summer the novel won huxley british literary award the james tait black memorial prize for fiction huxley also incorporated bird into the novel during this period huxley earned substantial income as hollywood screenwriter christopher isherwood in his autobiography my guru and his disciple states that huxley earned more than per week an enormous sum in those days as screenwriter and that he used much of it to transport jewish and left wing writer and artist refugees from hitler germany to the us in march his friend anita loos novelist and screenwriter put him in touch with metro goldwyn mayer who hired huxley for madame curie which was originally to star greta garbo and be directed by george cukor eventually the film was completed by mgm in with different director and cast huxley received screen credit for pride and prejudice and was paid for his work on number of other films including jane eyre huxley was commissioned by walt disney in to write script based on alice adventures in wonderland and the biography of the story author lewis carroll the script was not used however huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of unwin book hopousia or the sexual and economic foundations of new society on october huxley wrote to george orwell author of nineteen eighty four congratulating him on how fine and how profoundly important the book is in his letter to orwell he predicted huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself from these he made some warnings in his writings and talks in televised interview conducted by journalist mike wallace huxley outlined several major concerns the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organisation the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to wily persuasion the tendency to promote modern politicians to naive public as well marketed commodities post world war ii in huxley and maria applied for united states citizenship and presented themselves for examination when huxley refused to bear arms for the us and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals the only excuse allowed under the mccarran act the judge had to adjourn the proceedings he withdrew his application nevertheless he remained in the us in huxley turned down an offer of knight bachelor by the macmillan government without putting forward reason his brother julian had been knighted in while another brother andrew would be knighted in association with vedanta beginning in and continuing until his death in huxley had an extensive association with the vedanta society of southern california founded and headed by swami prabhavananda together with gerald heard christopher isherwood and other followers he was initiated by the swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices in huxley wrote the introduction to the bhagavad gita the song of god translated by swami prabhavananda and christopher isherwood which was published by the vedanta society of southern california from until huxley contributed articles to vedanta and the west published by the society he also served on the editorial board with isherwood heard and playwright john van druten from through huxley also occasionally lectured at the hollywood and santa barbara vedanta temples two of those lectures have been released on cd knowledge and understanding and who are we from nonetheless huxley agnosticism together with his speculative propensity made it difficult for him to fully embrace any form of religion in the spring of huxley had his first experience with psychedelic drugs in this case mescaline huxley had initiated correspondence with dr humphry osmond british psychiatrist then employed in canadian institution and eventually asked him to supply dose of mescaline osmond obliged and supervised huxley session in southern california after the publication of the doors of perception in which he recounted this experience huxley and swami prabhavananda disagreed about the meaning and importance of the psychedelic drug experience which may have caused the relationship to cool but huxley continued to write articles for the society journal lecture at the temple and attend social functions eyesight there are differing accounts about the details of the quality of huxley eyesight at specific points in his life about huxley encountered the bates method for better eyesight and teacher margaret darst corbett who was able to teach the method to him in huxley relocated from hollywood to ranchito in the high desert hamlet of llano california in northern los angeles county huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the bates method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern american desert he reported that for the first time in more than years he was able to read without glasses and without strain he even tried driving car along the dirt road beside the ranch he wrote book about his successes with the bates method the art of seeing which was published in us uk the book contained some generally disputed theories and its publication created growing degree of popular controversy about huxley eyesight it was and is widely believed that huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at oxford for example some ten years after publication of the art of seeing in bennett cerf was present when huxley spoke at hollywood banquet wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty then suddenly he faltered and the disturbing truth became obvious he wasn reading his address at all he had learned it by heart to refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes when it was only an inch or so away he still couldn read it and had to fish for magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him it was an agonising moment brazilian author joão ubaldo ribeiro who as young journalist spent several evenings in the huxleys company in the late wrote that huxley had said to him with wry smile can hardly see at all and don give damn really ribeiro then proceeds to confirm bennett cerf experience as described above on the other hand huxley second wife laura archera would later emphasise in her biographical account this timeless moment one of the great achievements of his life that of having regained his sight after revealing letter she wrote to the los angeles times disclaiming the label of huxley as poor fellow who can hardly see by walter alvarez she tempered this although feel it was an injustice to treat aldous as though he were blind it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision for instance although aldous did not wear glasses he would quite often use magnifying lens laura huxley proceeded to elaborate few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to huxley vision her account in this respect is discernibly congruent with the following sample of huxley own words from the art of seeing the most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism or any part of the organism is that it is not constant but highly variable nevertheless the topic of huxley eyesight continues to endure similar significant controversy regardless of how trivial subject matter it might initially appear american popular science author steven johnson in his book mind wide open quotes huxley about his difficulties with visual encoding am and for as long as can remember have always been poor visualizer words even the pregnant words of poets do not evoke pictures in my mind no hypnagogic visions greet me on the verge of sleep when recall something the memory does not present itself to me as vividly seen event or object by an effort of the will can evoke not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon personal life huxley married maria nys september february belgian he met at garsington oxfordshire in they had one child matthew huxley april february who had career as an author anthropologist and prominent epidemiologist in maria died of cancer in huxley married laura archera also an author as well as violinist and psychotherapist she wrote this timeless moment biography of huxley laura felt inspired to illuminate the story of their marriage through mary ann braubach documentary huxley on huxley in huxley was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer and in the years that followed with his health deteriorating he wrote the utopian novel island and gave lectures on human potentialities both at the university of california san francisco medical center and at the esalen institute these lectures were fundamental to the beginning of the human potential movement huxley was close friend of jiddu krishnamurti and rosalind rajagopal and was involved in the creation of the happy valley school now besant hill school of happy valley in ojai california the most substantial collection of huxley few remaining papers following the destruction of most in fire is at the library of the university of california los angeles some are also at the stanford university libraries on april huxley was informed he was elected companion of literature by the royal society of literature the senior literary organisation in britain and he accepted the title via letter on april the correspondence between huxley and the society are kept at the cambridge university library the society invited huxley to appear at banquet and give lecture at somerset house london in june huxley wrote draft of the speech he intended to give at the society however his deteriorating health meant he would not be able to attend death on his deathbed unable to speak due to advanced laryngeal cancer huxley made written request to his wife laura for lsd µg intramuscular according to her account of his death in this timeless moment she obliged with an injection at and second dose an hour later huxley died aged at los angeles time on november media coverage of huxley death as with that of the author lewis was overshadowed by the assassination of us president john kennedy on the same day this coincidence served as the basis for peter kreeft book between heaven and hell dialog somewhere beyond death with john kennedy lewis aldous huxley which imagines conversation among the three men taking place in purgatory following their deaths huxley memorial service took place in london in december which was led by his older brother julian and on october his ashes were interred in the family grave at the watts cemetery home of the watts mortuary chapel in compton guildford surrey england huxley had been long time friend of russian composer igor stravinsky who later dedicated his last orchestral composition to huxley stravinsky began

the american national standards institute ansi is private non profit organization that oversees the development of voluntary consensus standards for products services processes systems and personnel in the united states the organization also coordinates standards with international standards so that american products can be used worldwide ansi accredits standards that are developed by representatives of other standards organizations government agencies consumer groups companies and others these standards ensure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent that people use the same definitions and terms and that products are tested the same way ansi also accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards the organization headquarters are in washington ansi operations office is located in new york city the ansi annual operating budget is funded by the sale of publications membership dues and fees accreditation services fee based programs and international standards programs history ansi was originally formed in when five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the american engineering standards committee aesc in the aesc became the american standards association asa in the asa was reorganized and became united states of america standards institute usasi the present name was adopted in prior to these five founding engineering societies american institute of electrical engineers aiee now ieee american society of mechanical engineers asme american society of civil engineers asce american institute of mining engineers aime now american institute of mining metallurgical and petroleum engineers american society for testing and materials now astm international had been members of the united engineering society ues at the behest of the aiee they invited the government departments of war navy combined in to become the department of defense or dod and commerce to join in founding national standards organization according to adam stanton the first permanent secretary and head of staff in aesc started as an ambitious program and little else staff for the first year consisted of one executive clifford lepage who was on loan from founding member asme an annual budget of was provided by the founding bodies in the organization renamed asa in became affiliated with the national committee of the international commission iec which had been formed in to develop electrical and electronics standards members ansi members are government agencies organizations corporations academic and international bodies and individuals in total the institute represents the interests of more than companies and million professionals process though ansi itself does not develop standards the institute oversees the development and use of standards by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations ansi accreditation signifies that the procedures used by standards developing organizations meet the institute requirements for openness balance consensus and due process ansi also designates specific standards as american national standards or ans when the institute determines that the standards were developed in an environment that is equitable accessible and responsive to the requirements of various stakeholders voluntary consensus standards quicken the market acceptance of products while making clear how to improve the safety of those products for the protection of consumers there are approximately american national standards that carry the ansi designation the american national standards process involves consensus by group that is open to representatives from all interested parties broad based public review and comment on draft standards consideration of and response to comments incorporation of submitted changes that meet the same consensus requirements into draft standard availability of an appeal by any participant alleging that these principles were not respected during the standards development process international activities in addition to facilitating the formation of standards in the united states ansi promotes the use of standards internationally advocates policy and technical positions in international and regional standards organizations and encourages the adoption of international standards as national standards where appropriate the institute is the official representative to the two major international standards organizations the international organization for standardization iso as founding member and the international commission iec via the national committee usnc ansi participates in almost the entire technical program of both the iso and the iec and administers many key committees and subgroups in many instances standards are taken forward to iso and iec through ansi or the usnc where they are adopted in whole or in

an explanation of the superscripts and subscripts seen in atomic number notation atomic number is the number of protons and therefore also the total positive charge in the atomic nucleus the rutherford bohr model of the hydrogen atom or hydrogen like ion in this model it is an essential feature that the photon energy or frequency of the electromagnetic radiation emitted shown when an electron jumps from one orbital to another be proportional to the mathematical square of atomic charge experimental measurement by henry moseley of this radiation for many elements from showed the results as predicted by bohr both the concept of atomic number and the bohr model were thereby given scientific credence the atomic number or proton number symbol of chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom it is identical to the charge number of the nucleus the atomic number uniquely identifies chemical element in an uncharged atom the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons the sum of the atomic number and the number of neutrons gives the mass number of an atom since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes and the mass defect of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass the atomic mass of any atom when expressed in unified atomic mass units making quantity called the relative isotopic mass is within of the whole number atoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers and hence different atomic masses are known as isotopes little more than three quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as mixture of isotopes see monoisotopic elements and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element called the relative atomic mass in defined environment on earth determines the element standard atomic weight historically it was these atomic weights of elements in comparison to hydrogen that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the th century the conventional symbol comes from the german word meaning number which prior to the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics merely denoted an element numerical place in the periodic table whose order is approximately but not completely consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights only after with the suggestion and evidence that this number was also the nuclear charge and physical characteristic of atoms did the word and its english equivalent atomic number come into common use in this context history the periodic table and natural number for each element russian chemist dmitri mendeleev created periodic table of the elements that ordered them numerically by atomic weight yet occasionally used chemical properties in contradiction to weight loosely speaking the existence or construction of periodic table of elements creates an ordering of the elements and so they can be numbered in order dmitri mendeleev claimed that he arranged his first periodic tables in order of atomic weight atomgewicht however in consideration of the elements observed chemical properties he changed the order slightly and placed tellurium atomic weight ahead of iodine atomic weight this placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number but that number was not known or suspected at the time simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory however besides the case of iodine and tellurium later several other pairs of elements such as argon and potassium cobalt and nickel were known to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights thus requiring their placement in the periodic table to be determined by their chemical properties however the gradual identification of more and more chemically similar lanthanide elements whose atomic number was not obvious led to inconsistency and uncertainty in the periodic numbering of elements at least from lutetium element onwards hafnium was not known at this time niels bohr bohr model of the atom required van den broek atomic number of nuclear charges and bohr believed that moseley work contributed greatly to the acceptance of the model henry moseley helped develop the concept of atomic number by showing experimentally that van den broek hypothesis combined with the bohr model nearly correctly predicted atomic ray emissions the rutherford bohr model and van den broek in ernest rutherford gave model of the atom in which central core held most of the atom mass and positive charge which in units of the electron charge was to be approximately equal to half of the atom atomic weight expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms this central charge would thus be approximately half the atomic weight though it was almost different from the atomic number of gold the single element from which rutherford made his guess nevertheless in spite of rutherford estimation that gold had central charge of about but was element on the periodic table month after rutherford paper appeared antonius van den broek first formally suggested that the central charge and number of electrons in an atom was exactly equal to its place in the periodic table also known as element number atomic number and symbolized this proved eventually to be the case moseley experiment the experimental position improved dramatically after research by henry moseley in moseley after discussions with bohr who was at the same lab and who had used van den broek hypothesis in his bohr model of the atom decided to test van den broek and bohr hypothesis directly by seeing if spectral lines emitted from excited atoms fitted the bohr theory postulation that the frequency of the spectral lines be proportional to the square of to do this moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions and lines produced by the elements from aluminum to gold used as series of movable anodic targets inside an ray tube the square root of the frequency of these photons increased from one target to the next in an arithmetic progression this led to the conclusion moseley law that the atomic number does closely correspond with an offset of one unit for lines in moseley work to the calculated electric charge of the nucleus the element number among other things moseley demonstrated that the lanthanide series from lanthanum to lutetium inclusive must have members no fewer and no more which was far from obvious from the chemistry at that time missing elements after moseley death in the atomic numbers of all known elements from hydrogen to uranium were examined by his method there were seven elements with which were not found and therefore identified as still undiscovered corresponding to atomic numbers and from to all seven of these missing elements were discovered by this time the first four transuranium elements had also been discovered so that the periodic table was complete with no gaps as far as curium the proton and the idea of nuclear electrons in the reason for nuclear charge being quantized in units of which were now recognized to be the same as the element number was not understood an old idea called prout hypothesis had postulated that the elements were all made of residues or protyles of the lightest element hydrogen which in the bohr rutherford model had single electron and nuclear charge of one however as early as rutherford and thomas royds had shown that alpha particles which had charge of were the nuclei of helium atoms which had mass four times that of hydrogen not two times if prout hypothesis were true something had to be neutralizing some of the charge of the hydrogen nuclei present in the nuclei of heavier atoms in rutherford succeeded in generating hydrogen nuclei from nuclear reaction between alpha particles and nitrogen gas and believed he had proven prout law he called the new heavy nuclear particles protons in alternate names being proutons and protyles it had been immediately apparent from the work of moseley that the nuclei of heavy atoms have more than twice as much mass as would be expected from their being made of hydrogen nuclei and thus there was required hypothesis for the neutralization of the extra protons presumed present in all heavy nuclei helium nucleus was presumed to be composed of four protons plus two nuclear electrons electrons bound inside the nucleus to cancel two of the charges at the other end of the periodic table nucleus of gold with mass times that of hydrogen was thought to contain nuclear electrons in the nucleus to give it residual charge of consistent with its atomic number the discovery of the neutron makes the proton number all consideration of nuclear electrons ended with james chadwick discovery of the neutron in an atom of gold now was seen as containing neutrons rather than nuclear electrons and its positive charge now was realized to come entirely from content of protons after therefore an element atomic number was also realized to be identical to the proton number of its nuclei the symbol of the conventional symbol possibly comes from the german word atomic number however prior to the word zahl simply number was used for an element assigned number in the periodic table chemical properties each element has specific set of chemical properties as consequence of the number of electrons present in the neutral atom which is the atomic number the configuration of these electrons follows from the principles of quantum mechanics the number of electrons in each element electron shells particularly the outermost valence shell is the primary factor in determining its chemical bonding behavior hence it is the atomic number alone that determines the chemical properties of an element and it is for this reason that an element can be defined as consisting of any mixture of atoms with given atomic number new elements the quest for new elements is usually described using atomic numbers as of all elements with atomic numbers to have been observed synthesis of new elements is accomplished by bombarding target atoms of heavy elements with ions such that the sum of the atomic numbers of the target and ion elements equals the atomic number of the element being created in general the half life becomes shorter as atomic number increases though an island of stability may exist for undiscovered isotopes with certain numbers of protons and neutrons see also history of the periodic table effective atomic number

the aardvark orycteropus afer is medium sized burrowing nocturnal mammal native to africa it is the only living species of the order tubulidentata although other prehistoric species and genera of tubulidentata are known unlike other insectivores it has long pig like snout which is used to sniff out food it roams over most of the southern two thirds of the african continent avoiding areas that are mainly rocky nocturnal feeder it subsists on ants and termites which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs it also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young it receives least concern rating from the iucn although its numbers seem to be decreasing naming and taxonomy naming the aardvark is sometimes colloquially called african ant bear anteater not to be confused with the south american anteater or the cape anteater after the cape of good hope the name aardvark comes from earlier afrikaans erdvark and means earth pig or ground pig aarde earth ground vark pig because of its burrowing habits similar origin to the name groundhog the name orycteropus means burrowing foot and the name afer refers to africa the name of the aardvarks order tubulidentata comes from the tubule style teeth taxonomy the aardvark is not closely related to the pig rather it is the sole extant representative of the obscure mammalian order tubulidentata in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus orycteropus the sole surviving genus in the family orycteropodidae the aardvark is not closely related to the south american anteater despite sharing some characteristics and superficial resemblance the similarities are based on convergent evolution the closest living relatives of the aardvark are the elephant shrews tenrecs and golden moles along with the sirenians hyraxes elephants and their extinct relatives these animals form the superorder afrotheria studies of the brain have shown the similarities with condylarthra and given the clade status as wastebasket taxon it may mean some species traditionally classified as condylarths are actually stem aardvarks evolutionary history based on fossils bryan patterson has concluded that early relatives of the aardvark appeared in africa around the end of the paleocene the ptolemaiidans mysterious clade of mammals with uncertain affinities may actually be stem aardvarks either as sister clade to tubulidentata or as grade leading to true tubulidentates the first unambiguous tubulidentate was probably myorycteropus africanus from kenyan miocene deposits the earliest example from the orycteropus genus was the orycteropus mauritanicus found in algeria in deposits from the middle miocene with an equally aged version found in kenya fossils from the aardvark have been dated to million years and have been located throughout europe and the near east the mysterious pleistocene from madagascar was originally thought to be tubulidentate that was descended from ancestors that entered the island during the eocene however number of subtle anatomical differences coupled with recent molecular evidence now lead researchers to believe that is relative of golden moles and tenrecs that achieved an aardvark like appearance and ecological niche through convergent evolution subspecies the aardvark has seventeen poorly defined subspecies listed

matschiei grote observandus grote ruvanensis grote senegalensis lesson somalicus lydekker wardi lydekker wertheri matschie the encyclopædia britannica also mentions capensis or cape ant bear from south africa description an aardvark skeleton and mounted individual the aardvark is vaguely pig like in appearance its body is stout with prominently arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs the limbs are of moderate length with the rear legs being longer than the forelegs the front feet have lost the pollex or thumb resulting in four toes while the rear feet have all five toes each toe bears large robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovel like and appears to be intermediate between claw and hoof whereas the aardvark is considered digitigrade it appears at time to be plantigrade this confusion happens because when it squats it stands on its soles an aardvark weight is typically between an aardvark length is usually between and can reach lengths of when its tail which can be up to is taken into account it is tall at the shoulder and has girth of about it is the largest member of the proposed clade the aardvark is pale yellowish gray in color and often stained reddish brown by soil the aardvark coat is thin and the animal primary protection is its tough skin its hair is short on its head and tail however its legs tend to have longer hair the hair on the majority of its body is grouped in clusters of hairs the hair surrounding its nostrils is dense to help filter particulate matter out as it digs its tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers head the greatly elongated head is set on short thick neck and the end of the snout bears disc which houses the nostrils it contains thin but complete zygomatic arch the head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features one of the most distinctive characteristics of the tubulidentata is their teeth instead of having pulp cavity each tooth has cluster of thin hexagonal upright parallel tubes of vasodentin modified form of dentine with individual pulp canals held together by cementum the number of columns is dependent on the size of the tooth with the largest having about the teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously the aardvark is born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw which fall out and are not replaced adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the jaw and have dental formula of these remaining teeth are peg like and rootless and are of unique composition the teeth consist of upper and lower jaw molars the nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area as it contains ten nasal conchae more than any other placental mammal the sides of the nostrils are thick with hair the tip of the snout is highly mobile and is moved by modified mimetic muscles the fleshy dividing tissue between its nostrils probably has sensory functions but it is uncertain whether they are olfactory or vibratory in nature its nose is made up of more turbinate bones than any other mammal with between and compared to dogs with to with large quantity of turbinate bones the aardvark has more space for the moist epithelium which is the location of the olfactory bulb the nose contains nine olfactory bulbs more than any other mammal its keen sense of smell is not just from the quantity of bulbs in the nose but also in the development of the brain as its olfactory lobe is very developed the snout resembles an elongated pig snout the mouth is small and tubular typical of species that feed on ants and termites the aardvark has long thin snakelike protruding tongue as much as long and elaborate structures supporting keen sense of smell the ears which are very effective are long about long the eyes are small for its head and consist only of rods digestive system the aardvark stomach has muscular pyloric area that acts as gizzard to grind swallowed food up thereby rendering chewing unnecessary its cecum is large both sexes emit strong smelling secretion from an anal gland its salivary glands are highly developed and almost completely ring the neck their output is what causes the tongue to maintain its tackiness the female has two pairs of teats in the inguinal region genetically speaking the aardvark is living fossil as its chromosomes are highly conserved reflecting much of the early eutherian arrangement before the divergence of the major modern taxa habitat and range aardvarks are found in sub saharan africa where suitable habitat savannas grasslands woodlands and bushland and food ants and termites is available they spend the daylight hours in dark underground burrows to avoid the heat of the day the only major habitat that they are not present in is swamp forest as the high water table precludes digging to sufficient depth they also avoid terrain rocky enough to cause problems with digging they have been documented as high as in ethiopia they are present throughout sub saharan africa all the way to south africa with few exceptions these exceptions include the coastal areas of namibia ivory coast and ghana they are not found in madagascar ecology and behavior aardvark resting entrance to burrow emerging from burrow aardvarks live for up to years in captivity its keen hearing warns it of predators lions leopards cheetahs hunting dogs hyenas and pythons some humans also hunt aardvarks for meat aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies but if all else fails they will strike with their claws tail and shoulders sometimes flipping onto their backs lying motionless except to lash out with all four feet they are capable of causing substantial damage to unprotected areas of an attacker they will also dig to escape as they can when pressed dig extremely quickly their thick skin also protects them to some extent feeding the aardvark is nocturnal and is solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ants and termites formivore the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the aardvark cucumber in fact the cucumber and the aardvark have symbiotic relationship as they eat the subterranean fruit then defecate the seeds near their burrows which then grow rapidly due to the loose soil and fertile nature of the area the time spent in the intestine of the aardvark helps the fertility of the seed and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark they avoid eating the african driver ant and red ants due to their stringent diet requirements they require large range to survive an aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset and forages over considerable home range encompassing while foraging for food the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food they zig zag as they forage and will usually not repeat route for days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it again during foraging period they will stop and dig shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as means to explore their location when concentration of ants or termites is detected the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long sticky tongue as many as in one night have been recorded its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of termite or ant mound quickly it avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostrils when successful the aardvark long up to tongue licks up the insects the termites biting or the ants stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin after an aardvark visit at termite mound other animals will visit to pick up all the leftovers termite mounds alone don provide enough food for the aardvark so they look for termites that are on the move when these insects move they can form columns long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark these columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals the trampled grass and dung attract termites from odontotermes microtermes and genera on nightly basis they tend to be more active during the first portion of the night time however they don seem to prefer bright or dark nights over the other during adverse weather or if disturbed they will retreat to their burrow systems they cover between per night however some studies have shown that they may traverse as far as in night vocalization the aardvark is rather quiet animal however it does make soft grunting sounds as it forages and loud grunts as it makes for its tunnel entrance it makes bleating sound if frightened when it is threatened it will make for one of its burrows if one is not close it will dig new one rapidly this new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear movement the aardvark is known to be good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents it can dig yard of tunnel in about five minutes but otherwise moves fairly slowly when leaving the burrow at night they pause at the entrance for about ten minutes sniffing and listening after this period of watchfulness it will bound out and within seconds it will be away it will then pause prick its ears twisting its head to listen then jump and move off to start foraging aside from digging out ants and termites the aardvark also excavates burrows in which to live of which they generally fall into three categories burrows made while foraging refuge and resting location and permanent homes temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are used as refuges while the main burrow is also used for breeding main burrows can be deep and extensive have several entrances and can be as long as these burrows can be large enough for man to enter the aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly and periodically moves on and makes new one the old burrows are an important part of the african wildlife scene as they are vacated then they are inhabited by smaller animals like the african wild dog ant eating chat nycteris thebaica and warthogs other animals that use them are hares mongooses hyenas owls pythons and lizards without these refuges many animals would die during wildfire season only mothers and young share burrows however the aardvark is known to live in small family groups or as solitary creature if attacked in the tunnel it will escape by digging out of the tunnel thereby placing the fresh fill between it and its predator or if it decides to fight it will roll onto its back and attack with its claws the aardvark has been known to sleep in recently excavated ant nest which also serves as protection from its predators reproduction aardvark mother and young aardvarks pair only during the breeding season after gestation period of seven months one cub weighing around is born during may july when born the young has flaccid ears and many wrinkles when nursing it will nurse off each teat in succession after two weeks the folds of skin disappear and after three the ears can be held upright after weeks body hair starts growing it is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks and eats termites at weeks and is weaned between three months and weeks at six months of age it is able to dig its own burrows but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season and is sexually mature from approximately two years of age conservation aardvarks were thought to have declining numbers however this is possibly due to the fact that they are not readily seen there are no definitive counts because of their nocturnal and secretive habits however their numbers seem to be stable overall they are not considered common anywhere in africa but due to their large range they maintain sufficient numbers there may be slight decrease in numbers in eastern northern and western africa southern african numbers are not decreasing it receives an official designation from the iucn as least concern however they are species in precarious situation as they are so dependent on such specific food therefore if problem arises with the abundance of termites the species as whole would be affected drastically aardvarks handle captivity well the first zoo to have one was london zoo in which had an animal from south africa mythology and popular culture tomcat from vf aardvarks with the squadron mascot painted on the tail in african folklore the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to soldier ants hausa magicians make charm from the heart skin forehead and nails of the aardvark which they then proceed to pound together with the root of certain tree wrapped in piece of skin and worn on the chest the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night the charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents permission also some tribes such as the

the aardwolf proteles cristata is small insectivorous mammal native to east and southern africa its name means earth wolf in afrikaans and dutch it is also called maanhaar jackal afrikaans for mane jackal or civet hyena based on its habit of secreting substances from its anal gland characteristic shared with the civet the aardwolf is in the same family as the hyena unlike many of its relatives in the order carnivora the aardwolf does not hunt large animals it eats insects mainly termites one aardwolf can eat about termites during single night using its long sticky tongue to capture them the aardwolf lives in the shrublands of eastern and southern africa open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs it is nocturnal resting in burrows during the day and emerging at night to seek food its diet consists mainly of termites and insect larvae taxonomy the aardwolf is the only surviving species in the mammalian subfamily protelinae there is disagreement as to whether the species is monotypic or can be divided into subspecies cristatus of southern africa and septentrionalis of east africa recent studies have shown that the aardwolf probably broke away from the rest of the hyena family early on however how early is still unclear as the fossil record and genetic studies disagree by million years the aardwolf is generally classified with the hyaenidae though it was formerly placed into the family protelidae early on scientists felt that it was merely mimicking the striped hyena which subsequently led to the creation of protelidae etymology the generic name proteles comes from two words both of greek origin protos and teleos which combined means complete in front based on the fact that they have five toes on their front feet and four on the rear the specific name cristatus comes from latin and means provided with comb relating to their mane physical characteristics detail of head taken at the cincinnati zoo the aardwolf resembles very thin striped hyena but with more slender muzzle black vertical stripes on coat of yellowish fur and long distinct mane down the midline of the neck and back it also has one or two diagonal stripes down the fore and hind quarters along with several stripes on its legs the mane is raised during confrontations to make the aardwolf appear larger it is missing the throat spot that others in the family have its lower leg from the knee down is all black and its tail is bushy with black tip the aardwolf is about long excluding its bushy tail which is about long and stands about tall at the shoulders an adult aardwolf weighs approximately sometimes reaching the aardwolves in the south of the continent tend to be smaller about whereas the eastern version weighs more around the front feet have five toes each unlike the four toed hyena the teeth and skull are similar to those of other hyenas though smaller and its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects it does still have canines but unlike other hyenas these teeth are used primarily for fighting and defense its ears which are large are very similar to those of the striped hyena as an aardwolf ages it will normally lose some of its teeth though this has little impact on its feeding habits due to the softness of the insects that it eats aardwolf skull distribution and habitat aardwolves live in open dry plains and bushland avoiding mountainous areas due to their specific food requirements they are only found in regions where termites of the family hodotermitidae occur termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed grasslands and savannahs including farmland for most of the year aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to dozen dens which are occupied for six weeks at time there are two distinct populations one in southern africa and another in east and northeast africa the species does not occur in the intermediary miombo forests an adult pair along with their most recent offspring occupies territory of behavior san antonio zoo aardwolves are shy and nocturnal sleeping in underground burrows by day they will on occasion during the winter become diurnal feeders this happens during the coldest periods as they then stay in at night to conserve heat they have often been mistaken for solitary animals in fact they live as monogamous pairs with their young if their territory is infringed upon they will chase the intruder up to or to the border if the intruder is caught which rarely happens fight will occur which is accompanied by soft clucking hoarse barking and type of roar the majority of incursions occur during mating season when they can occur once or twice per week when food is scarce the stringent territorial system may be abandoned and as many as three pairs may occupy single territory the territory is marked by both sexes as they both have developed anal glands from which they extrude black substance that is smeared on rocks or grass stalks in long streaks aardwolves also have scent glands on the forefoot and penile pad they often mark near termite mounds within their territory every minutes or so if they are patrolling their territorial boundaries the marking frequency increases drastically to once every at this rate an individual may mark marks per hour and upwards of per night an aardwolf pair may have up to dens and numerous middens within their territory when they deposit feces at their middens they dig small hole and then cover it with sand their dens are usually abandoned aardvark springhare or porcupine dens or on occasion they are crevices in rocks they will also dig their own dens or enlarge dens started by springhares they typically will only use one or two dens at time rotating through all of their dens every six months during the summer they may rest outside their den during the night and sleep underground during the heat of the day aardwolves are not fast runners nor are they particularly adept at fighting off predators therefore when threatened the aardwolf may attempt to mislead its foe by doubling back on its tracks if confronted it may raise its mane in an attempt to appear more menacing it also emits foul smelling liquid from its anal glands feeding the aardwolf feeds primarily on termites and more specifically on trinervitermes this genus of termites has different species throughout the aardwolf range in east africa they eat bettonianus and in central africa they eat rhodesiensis and finally in southern africa they eat trinervoides their technique consists of licking them off the ground as opposed to the aardvark which digs into the mound they locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites an aardwolf may consume up to termites per night using its sticky long tongue they do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide continuous supply of food they often memorize the location of such nests and return to them every few months during certain seasonal events such as the onset of the rainy season and the cold of midwinter the primary termites become scarce so the need for other foods becomes pronounced during these times the southern aardwolf will seek out hodotermes mossambicus type of harvester termite active in the afternoon which explains some of their diurnal behavior in the winter the eastern aardwolf during the rainy season subsists on termites from the genera odontotermes and macrotermes they are also known to feed on other insects larvae eggs and some sources say occasionally small mammals and birds but these constitute very small percentage of their total diet unlike other hyenas aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals contrary to popular myths aardwolves do not eat carrion and if they are seen eating while hunched over dead carcass they are actually eating larvae and beetles also contrary to some sources they do not like meat unless it is finely ground or cooked for them the adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups but more recent research has shown that they are primarily solitary foragers necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey their primary source trinervitermes forages in small but dense patches of while foraging the aardwolf can cover about per hour which translates to per summer night and per winter night breeding the breeding season varies depending on location but normally takes place during autumn or spring in south africa breeding occurs in early july during the breeding season unpaired male aardwolves search their own territory as well as others for female to mate with dominant males also mate with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves which can result in conflict between rival males dominant males even go step further and as the breeding season approaches they make increasingly greater and greater incursions onto weaker males territories as the female comes into oestrus they add pasting to their tricks inside of the other territories sometimes doing so more in rivals territories than their own females will also when given the opportunity mate with the dominant male which increases the chances of the dominant male guarding his cubs with her copulation lasts between and hours gestation lasts between and days producing two to five cubs most often two or three during the rainy season november december when termites are more active they are born with their eyes open but initially are helpless and weigh around the first six to eight weeks are spent in the den with their parents the male may spend up to six hours night watching over the cubs while the mother is out looking for food after three

the older cubs have moved on aardwolves generally achieve sexual maturity at one and half to two years of age conservation the aardwolf has not seen decreasing numbers and they are relatively widespread throughout eastern africa they are not common throughout their range as they maintain density of no more than per square kilometer if the food is good because of these factors the iucn has rated the aardwolf as least concern in some areas they are persecuted by man because of the mistaken belief that they prey on livestock however they are actually beneficial to the farmers because they eat termites that are detrimental in other areas the farmers have recognized this but they are still killed on occasion for their fur dogs and insecticides are also common killers of the aardwolf

trek across the southwestern deserts to texas crossing the colorado river into the confederate territory of arizona on july early in the civil war confederate president jefferson davis decided that the confederacy would attempt to hold as much of its territory as possible and therefore distributed military forces around its borders and coasts in the summer of davis appointed several generals to defend confederate lines from the mississippi river east to the allegheny mountains the most sensitive and in many ways the most crucial areas along the mississippi river and in western tennessee along the tennessee and the cumberland rivers were placed under the command of maj gen leonidas polk and brig gen gideon pillow the latter had initially been in command in tennessee as that state top general their impolitic occupation of columbus kentucky on september two days before johnston arrived in the confederacy capital of richmond virginia after his cross country journey drove kentucky from its stated neutrality the majority of kentuckians allied with the union camp polk and pillow action gave union brig gen ulysses grant an excuse to take control of the strategically located town of paducah kentucky without raising the ire of most kentuckians and the pro union majority in the state legislature confederate command in western theater on september johnston was assigned to command the huge area of the confederacy west of the allegheny mountains except for coastal areas he became commander of the confederacy western armies in the area often called the western department or western military department johnston appointment as full general by his friend and admirer jefferson davis already had been confirmed by the confederate senate on august the appointment had been backdated to rank from may making him the second highest ranking general in the confederate states army only adjutant general and inspector general samuel cooper ranked ahead of him after his appointment johnston immediately headed for his new territory he was permitted to call on governors of arkansas tennessee and mississippi for new troops although this authority was largely stifled by politics especially with respect to mississippi on september johnston ordered brig gen felix zollicoffer with men to occupy cumberland gap in kentucky in order to block union troops from coming into eastern tennessee the kentucky legislature had voted to side with the union after the occupation of columbus by polk by september johnston had brig gen simon bolivar buckner with another men blocking the railroad route to tennessee at bowling green kentucky johnston had fewer than men spread throughout kentucky tennessee arkansas and missouri of these were in missouri under missouri state guard maj gen sterling price johnston did not quickly gain many recruits when he first requested them from the governors but his more serious problem was lacking sufficient arms and ammunition for the troops he already had as the confederate government concentrated efforts on the units in the east they gave johnston small numbers of reinforcements and minimal amounts of arms and material johnston maintained his defense by conducting raids and other measures to make it appear he had larger forces than he did strategy that worked for several months johnston tactics had so annoyed and confused union brig gen william tecumseh sherman in kentucky that he became paranoid and mentally unstable sherman overestimated johnston forces and had to be relieved by brig gen don carlos buell on november battle of mill springs eastern tennessee was held for the confederacy by two unimpressive brigadier generals appointed by jefferson davis felix zollicoffer brave but untrained and inexperienced officer and soon to be maj gen george crittenden former army officer with apparent alcohol problems while crittenden was away in richmond zollicoffer moved his forces to the north bank of the upper cumberland river near mill springs now nancy kentucky putting the river to his back and his forces into trap zollicoffer decided it was impossible to obey orders to return to the other side of the river because of scarcity of transport and proximity of union troops when union brig gen george thomas moved against the confederates crittenden decided to attack one of the two parts of thomas command at logan cross roads near mill springs before the union forces could unite at the battle of mill springs on january the ill prepared confederates after night march in the rain attacked the union force with some initial success as the battle progressed zollicoffer was killed crittenden was unable to lead the confederate force he may have been intoxicated and the confederates were turned back and routed by union bayonet charge suffering casualties from their force of the confederate troops who escaped were assigned to other units as general crittenden faced an investigation of his conduct after the confederate defeat at the mill springs davis sent johnston brigade and few other scattered reinforcements he also assigned him gen beauregard who was supposed to attract recruits because of his victories early in the war and act as competent subordinate for johnston the brigade was led by brig gen john floyd considered incompetent he took command at fort donelson as the senior general present just before union brig gen ulysses grant attacked the fort historians believe the assignment of beauregard to the west stimulated union commanders to attack the forts before beauregard could make difference in the theater union officers heard that he was bringing regiments with him but this was an exaggeration of his forces fort henry fort donelson nashville based on the assumption that kentucky neutrality would act as shield against direct invasion from the north tennessee initially had sent men to virginia and concentrated defenses in the mississippi valley circumstances that no longer applied in september even before johnston arrived in tennessee construction of two forts had been started to defend the tennessee and the cumberland rivers which provided avenues into the state from the north both forts were located in tennessee in order to respect kentucky neutrality but these were not in ideal locations fort henry on the tennessee river was in an unfavorable low lying location commanded by hills on the kentucky side of the river fort donelson on the cumberland river although in better location had vulnerable land side and did not have enough heavy artillery to defend against gunboats maj gen polk ignored the problems of the forts when he took command after johnston took command polk at first refused to comply with johnston order to send an engineer lt joseph dixon to inspect the forts after johnston asserted his authority polk had to allow dixon to proceed dixon recommended that the forts be maintained and strengthened although they were not in ideal locations because much work had been done on them and the confederates might not have time to build new ones johnston accepted his recommendations johnston wanted major alexander stewart to command the forts but president davis appointed brig gen lloyd tilghman as commander to prevent polk from dissipating his forces by allowing some men to join partisan group johnston ordered him to send brig gen gideon pillow and men to fort donelson pillow took up position at nearby clarksville tennessee and did not move into the fort until february alerted by union reconnaissance on january johnston ordered tilghman to fortify the high ground opposite fort henry which polk had failed to do despite johnston orders tilghman failed to act decisively on these orders which in any event were too late to be adequately carried out gen beauregard arrived at johnston headquarters at bowling green on february and was given overall command of polk force at the western end of johnston line at columbus kentucky on february union navy gunboats quickly reduced the defenses of ill sited fort henry inflicting casualties on the small remaining confederate force brig gen lloyd tilghman surrendered the remaining officers and men of his approximately man force which had not been sent to fort donelson before grant force could even take up their positions johnston knew he could be trapped at bowling green if fort donelson fell so he moved his force to nashville the capital of tennessee and an increasingly important confederate industrial center beginning on february johnston also reinforced fort donelson with more men including those under floyd and pillow curious decision in view of his thought that the union gunboats alone might be able to take the fort he did order the commanders of the fort to evacuate the troops if the fort could not be held the senior generals sent to the fort to command the enlarged garrison gideon pillow and john floyd squandered their chance to avoid having to surrender most of the garrison and on february brig gen simon buckner having been abandoned by floyd and pillow surrendered fort donelson colonel nathan bedford forrest escaped with his cavalry force of about men before the surrender the confederates suffered about casualties with an estimated to taken prisoner union casualties were killed wounded missing johnston who had little choice in allowing floyd and pillow to take charge at fort donelson on the basis of seniority after he ordered them to add their forces to the garrison took the blame and suffered calls for his removal because full explanation to the press and public would have exposed the weakness of the confederate position his passive defensive performance while positioning himself in forward position at bowling green spreading his forces too thinly not concentrating his forces in the face of union advances and appointing or relying upon inadequate or incompetent subordinates subjected him to criticism at the time and by later historians the fall of the forts exposed nashville to imminent attack and it fell without resistance to union forces under brig gen buell on february two days after johnston had to pull his forces out in order to avoid having them captured as well concentration at corinth johnston had various remaining military units scattered throughout his territory and retreating to the south to avoid being cut off johnston himself retreated with the force under his personal command the army of central kentucky from the vicinity of nashville with beauregard help johnston decided to concentrate forces with those formerly under polk and now already under beauregard command at the strategically located railroad crossroads of corinth mississippi which he reached by circuitous route johnston kept the union forces now under the overall command of the ponderous maj gen henry halleck confused and hesitant to move allowing johnston to reach his objective undetected this delay allowed jefferson davis finally to send reinforcements from the garrisons of coastal cities and another highly rated but prickly general braxton bragg to help organize the western forces bragg at least calmed the nerves of beauregard and polk who had become agitated by their apparent dire situation in the face of numerically superior forces before the arrival of johnston on march johnston army of men gave the confederates combined force of about to men at corinth on march johnston officially took command of this combined force which continued to use the army of the mississippi name under which it had been organized by beauregard on march johnston now planned to defeat the union forces piecemeal before the various union units in kentucky and tennessee under grant with men at nearby pittsburg landing tennessee and the now maj gen don carlos buell on his way from nashville with men could unite against him johnston started his army in motion on april intent on surprising grant force as soon as the next day but they moved slowly due to their inexperience bad roads and lack of adequate staff planning due to the delays as well as several contacts with the enemy johnston second in command beauregard felt the element of surprise had been lost and recommended calling off the attack johnston decided to proceed as planned stating would fight them if they were million his army was finally in position within mile or two of grant force and undetected by the evening of april battle of shiloh and death monument to johnston at shiloh national military park johnston launched massive surprise attack with his concentrated forces against grant at the battle of shiloh on april as the confederate forces overran the union camps johnston seemed to be everywhere personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line on his horse at about pm while leading one of those charges against union camp near the peach orchard he was wounded taking bullet behind his right knee he apparently did not think the wound was serious at the time or even possibly did not feel it it is possible that johnston duel in had caused nerve damage or numbness to his right leg and that he did not feel the wound to his leg as result the bullet had in fact clipped part of his popliteal artery and his boot was filling up with blood there were no medical personnel on scene at the time since johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded confederate troops and yankee prisoners earlier in the battle within few minutes johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting among his staff was isham harris the governor of tennessee who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that abraham lincoln had appointed andrew johnson as military governor of tennessee seeing johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale harris asked general are you wounded johnston glanced down at his leg wound then faced harris and replied in weak voice his last words yes and fear seriously harris and other staff officers removed johnston from his horse and carried him to small ravine near the hornets nest and desperately tried to aid the general who had lost consciousness by this point harris then sent an aide to fetch johnston surgeon but did not apply tourniquet to johnson wounded leg before doctor could be found johnston died from blood loss few minutes later it is believed that johnston may have lived for as long as one hour after receiving his fatal wound ironically it was later discovered that johnston had tourniquet in his pocket when he died harris and the other officers wrapped general johnston body in blanket so as not to damage the troops morale with the sight of the dead general johnston and his wounded horse fire eater were taken to his field headquarters on the corinth road where his body remained in his tent until the confederate army withdrew to corinth the next day april after failing to gain decisive victory over the union armies from there his body was taken to the home of colonel william inge which had been his headquarters in corinth it was covered in the confederate flag and lay in state for several hours it is probable that confederate soldier fired the fatal round no union soldiers had ever been observed to have gotten behind johnston during the fatal charge but it is known that many confederates were firing at the union lines while johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers furthermore the surgeon who later dug the bullet out of johnston leg identified the round as one fired from pattern enfield no union troops in the area in which johnston was hit had been issued enfield rifles but the enfield rifle was standard issue for the confederate forces johnston was leading johnston was the highest ranking fatality of the war on either side and his death was strong blow to the morale of the confederacy at the time davis considered him the best general in the country legacy and honors tomb and statue by elisabet ney in the texas state cemetery in austin texas johnston was survived by his wife eliza and six children his wife and five younger children including one born after he went to war chose to live out their days at home in los angeles with eliza brother dr john strother griffin johnston eldest son albert sidney jr born in texas had already followed him into the confederate states army in after taking home leave in los angeles albert jr was on his way out of san pedro harbor on ferry while steamer was taking on passengers from the ferry wave swamped the smaller boat causing its boilers to explode albert jr was killed in the accident killed in action general johnston received the highest praise ever

northeast los angeles are named after the general and his family who lived in the neighborhood johnston was initially buried in new orleans in joint resolution of the texas legislature was passed to have his body moved and reinterred at the texas state cemetery in austin the re interment occurred in forty years later the state appointed elisabet ney to design monument and sculpture of him to be

albert einstein march april was german born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity one of the two pillars of modern physics alongside quantum mechanics einstein work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science einstein is best known by the general public for his mass energy equivalence formula which has been dubbed the world most famous equation he received the nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory near the beginning of his career einstein thought that newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field this led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the swiss patent office in bern switzerland however he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in he published paper on general relativity he continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules he also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light in einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the large scale structure of the universe between and he lived in switzerland except for one year in prague where he received his academic diploma from the swiss federal polytechnic in zürich later the eidgenössische technische hochschule eth in he later taught there at the same institute as professor of theoretical physics between and before he left for berlin in

world war ii he endorsed letter to president franklin roosevelt alerting him to the potential development of extremely powerful bombs of new type and recommending that the begin similar research this eventually led to what would become the manhattan project einstein supported defending the allied forces but generally denounced the idea of using the newly discovered nuclear fission as weapon later

family moved to pavia einstein stayed in munich to finish his studies at the luitpold gymnasium his father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering but einstein clashed with authorities and

his family in pavia convincing the school to let him go by using doctor note during his time in italy he wrote short essay with the title on the investigation of the state of the ether in magnetic field contrary to popular belief einstein never failed math he had learned integral and differential calculus on his own before he was years old in at the age of einstein took the entrance examinations for the swiss federal polytechnic in zürich later the eidgenössische technische hochschule eth he failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination but obtained

interest in einstein was awarded the zürich polytechnic teaching diploma but marić failed the examination with poor grade in the mathematics component theory of functions there have been claims that

property the patent office as an assistant examiner level iii einstein evaluated patent applications for variety of devices including gravel sorter and an typewriter in his position at the swiss patent office became permanent although he was passed over for promotion until he fully mastered machine technology much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical mechanical synchronization of time two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time with few friends he had met in bern einstein started small discussion group in self mockingly named the olympia academy which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy their readings included the works of henri poincaré ernst mach and david hume which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook first scientific papers einstein official portrait after receiving the nobel prize in physics in einstein paper folgerungen aus den conclusions from the capillarity phenomena was published in the journal annalen der physik on april einstein completed his thesis with alfred kleiner professor of experimental physics serving as pro forma advisor as result einstein was awarded phd by the university of zürich with his dissertation new determination of molecular dimensions in that same year which has been called einstein annus mirabilis miracle year he published four groundbreaking papers on the photoelectric effect brownian motion special relativity and the equivalence of mass and energy which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world at the age of academic career by he was recognized as leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the university of bern the following year after giving lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the university of zürich alfred kleiner recommended him to the faculty for newly created professorship in theoretical physics einstein was appointed associate professor in einstein became full professor at the german charles ferdinand university in prague in april accepting austrian citizenship in the austro hungarian empire to do so during his prague stay he wrote scientific works five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids in july he returned to his alma mater in zürich from until he was professor of theoretical physics at the eth zurich where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics he also studied continuum mechanics the molecular theory of heat and the problem of gravitation on which he worked with mathematician and friend marcel grossmann on july he was voted for membership in the prussian academy of sciences in berlin max planck and walther nernst visited him the next week in zurich to persuade him to join the academy additionally offering him the post of director at the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics which was soon to be established membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at the humboldt university of berlin he was officially elected to the academy on july and he accepted to move to the german empire the next year his decision to move to berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin elsa with whom he had developed romantic affair he joined the academy and thus the berlin university on april as world war broke out that year the plan for kaiser wilhelm institute for physics was aborted the institute was established on october with einstein as its director in einstein was elected president of the german physical society based on calculations einstein made in about his new theory of general relativity light from another star should be bent by the sun gravity in that prediction was confirmed by sir arthur eddington during the solar eclipse of may those observations were published in the international media making einstein world famous on november the leading british newspaper the times printed banner headline that read revolution in science new theory of the universe newtonian ideas overthrown in he became foreign member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences in he was awarded the nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect while the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial the citation also does not treat the cited work as an explanation but merely as discovery of the law as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the derivation of the planck spectrum by bose einstein was elected foreign member of the royal society formemrs in he also received the copley medal from the royal society in travels abroad albert einstein at session of the international committee on intellectual cooperation league of nations of which he was member from to einstein visited new york city for the first time on april where he received an official welcome by mayor john francis hylan followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions he went on to deliver several lectures at columbia university and princeton university and in washington he accompanied representatives of the national academy of science on visit to the white house on his return to europe he was the guest of the british statesman and philosopher viscount haldane in london where he met several renowned scientific intellectual and political figures and delivered lecture at king college london he also published an essay my first impression of the in july in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of americans much as had alexis de tocqueville who published his own impressions in democracy in america for some of his observations einstein was clearly surprised what strikes visitor is the joyous positive attitude to life the american is friendly self confident optimistic and without envy in his travels took him to asia and later to palestine as part of six month excursion and speaking tour as he visited singapore ceylon and japan where he gave series of lectures to thousands of japanese after his first public lecture he met the emperor and empress at the imperial palace where thousands came to watch in letter to his sons he described his impression of the japanese as being modest intelligent considerate and having true feel for art because of einstein travels to the far east he was unable to personally accept the nobel prize for physics at the stockholm award ceremony in december in his place the banquet speech was held by german diplomat who praised einstein not only as scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist on his return voyage he visited palestine for days in what would become his only visit to that region he was greeted as if he were head of state rather than physicist which included cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the british high commissioner sir herbert samuel during one reception the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him in einstein talk to the audience he expressed happiness that the jewish people were beginning to be recognized as force in the world einstein visited spain for two weeks in where he briefly met santiago ramón cajal and also received diploma from king alfonso xiii naming him member of the spanish academy of sciences from to einstein was involved in the works of the international committee on intellectual cooperation of the league of nations in geneva an organisation created to promote international exchange between scientists researchers teachers artists and intellectuals his former physics professor hendrik lorentz and the french chemist marie curie were also members of this committee travel to the in december einstein visited america for the second time originally intended as two month working visit as research fellow at the california institute of technology after the national attention he received during his first trip to the he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly he declined them all after arriving in new york city einstein was taken to various places and events including chinatown lunch with the editors of the new york times and performance of carmen at the metropolitan opera where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival during the days following he was given the keys to the city by mayor jimmy walker and met the president of columbia university who described einstein as the ruling monarch of the mind harry emerson fosdick pastor at new york riverside church gave einstein tour of the church and showed him full size statue that the church made of einstein standing at the entrance also during his stay in new york he joined crowd of people at madison square garden during hanukkah celebration einstein left and charlie chaplin at the hollywood premiere of city lights january einstein next traveled to california where he met caltech president and nobel laureate robert millikan his friendship with millikan was awkward as millikan had penchant for patriotic militarism where einstein was pronounced pacifist during an address to caltech students einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good this aversion to war also led einstein to befriend author upton sinclair and film star charlie chaplin both noted for their pacifism carl laemmle head of universal studios gave einstein tour of his studio and introduced him to chaplin they had an instant rapport with chaplin inviting einstein and his wife elsa to his home for dinner chaplin said einstein outward persona calm and gentle seemed to conceal highly emotional temperament from which came his extraordinary intellectual energy chaplin film city lights was to premiere few days later in hollywood and chaplin invited einstein and elsa to join him as his special guests walter isaacson einstein biographer described this as one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity chaplin visited einstein at his home on later trip to berlin and recalled his modest little flat and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory chaplin speculated that it was possibly used as kindling wood by the nazis emigration to the cartoon of einstein who has shed his pacifism wings standing next to pillar labeled world peace he is rolling up his sleeves and holding sword labeled preparedness by charles macauley in february while on visit to the united states einstein knew he could not return to germany with the rise to power of the nazis under germany new chancellor adolf hitler while at american universities in early he undertook his third two month visiting professorship at the california institute of technology in pasadena he and his wife elsa returned to belgium by ship in march and during the trip they learned that their cottage was raided by the nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated upon landing in antwerp on march he immediately went to the german consulate and surrendered his passport formally renouncing his german citizenship the nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into hitler youth camp refugee status albert einstein landing card may when he landed in dover united kingdom from ostende belgium to visit oxford in april einstein discovered that the new german government had passed laws barring jews from holding any official positions including teaching at universities historian gerald holton describes how with virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues thousands of jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed month later einstein works were among those targeted by the german student union in the nazi book burnings with nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels proclaiming jewish intellectualism is dead one german magazine included him in list of enemies of the german regime with the phrase not yet hanged offering bounty on his head in subsequent letter to physicist and friend max born who had already emigrated from germany to england einstein wrote must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of surprise after moving to the he described the book burnings as spontaneous emotional outburst by those who shun popular enlightenment and more than anything else in the world fear the influence of men of intellectual independence einstein was now without permanent home unsure where he would live and work and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in germany he rented house in de haan belgium where he lived for few months in late july he went to england for about six weeks at the personal invitation of british naval officer commander oliver locker lampson who had become friends with einstein in the preceding years to protect einstein locker lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside london with photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding einstein published in the daily herald on july locker lampson took einstein to meet winston churchill at his home and later austen chamberlain and former prime minister lloyd george einstein asked them to help bring jewish scientists out of germany british historian martin gilbert notes that churchill responded immediately and sent his friend physicist frederick lindemann to germany to seek out jewish scientists and place them in british universities churchill later observed that as result of germany having driven the jews out they had lowered their technical standards and put the allies technology ahead of theirs einstein later contacted leaders of other nations including turkey prime minister ismet inönü to whom he wrote in september requesting placement of unemployed german jewish scientists as result of einstein letter jewish invitees to turkey eventually totaled over saved individuals locker lampson also submitted bill to parliament to extend british citizenship to einstein during which period einstein made number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in europe in one of his speeches he denounced germany treatment of jews while at the same time he introduced bill promoting jewish citizenship in palestine as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere in his speech he described einstein as citizen of the world who should be offered temporary shelter in the both bills failed however and einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the princeton institute for advanced study in the to become resident scholar resident scholar at the princeton institute for advanced study portrait taken in in princeton in october einstein returned to the and took up position at the institute for advanced study noted for having become refuge for scientists fleeing nazi germany at the time most american universities including harvard princeton and yale had minimal or no jewish faculty or students as result of their jewish quota which lasted until the late einstein was still undecided on his future he had offers from several european universities including christ church oxford where he stayed for three short periods between may and june and was offered year studentship but in he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the united states and apply for citizenship einstein affiliation with the institute for advanced study would last until his death in he was one of the four first selected two of the others being john von neumann and kurt gödel at the new institute where he soon developed close friendship with gödel the two would take long walks together discussing their work bruria kaufman his assistant later became physicist during this period einstein tried to develop unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics both unsuccessfully world war ii and the manhattan project in group of hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist leó szilárd attempted to alert washington to ongoing nazi atomic bomb research the group warnings were discounted einstein and szilárd along with other refugees such as edward teller and eugene wigner regarded it as their responsibility to alert americans to the possibility that german scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb and to warn that hitler would be more than willing to resort to such weapon to make certain the was aware of the danger in july few months before the beginning of world war ii in europe szilárd and wigner visited einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs which einstein pacifist said he had never considered he was asked to lend his support by writing letter with szilárd to president roosevelt recommending the pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research the letter is believed to be arguably the key stimulus for the adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the entry into world war ii in addition to the letter einstein used his connections with the belgian royal family and the belgian queen mother to get access with personal envoy to the white house oval office president roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing hitler to possess atomic bombs first as result of einstein letter and his meetings with roosevelt the entered the race to develop the bomb drawing on its immense material financial and scientific resources to initiate the manhattan project the became the only country to successfully develop nuclear weapons during world war ii and also remains the only country to have used them in combat against hiroshima and nagasaki on and august respectively towards the end of the war for einstein war was disease and he called for resistance to war by signing the letter to roosevelt he went against his pacifist principles in year before his death einstein said to his old friend linus pauling made one great mistake in my life when signed the letter to president roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made but there was some justification the danger that the germans would make them citizenship citizenship certificate from judge phillip forman einstein became an american citizen in not long after settling into his career at the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in american culture when compared to europe he recognized the right of individuals to say and think what they pleased without social barriers and as result individuals were encouraged he said to be more creative trait he valued from his own early education personal life supporter of civil rights einstein was passionate committed antiracist and joined national association for the advancement of colored people naacp in princeton where he campaigned for the civil rights of african americans he considered racism america worst disease seeing it as handed down from one generation to the next as part of his involvement he corresponded with civil rights activist du bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in when einstein offered to be character witness for du bois the judge decided to drop the case einstein in in einstein visited lincoln university in pennsylvania historically black college where he was awarded an honorary degree lincoln was the first university in the united states to grant college degrees to african americans alumni include langston hughes and thurgood marshall einstein gave speech about racism in america adding do not intend to be quiet about it resident of princeton recalls that einstein had once paid the college tuition for black student assisting zionist causes einstein was figurehead leader in helping establish the hebrew university of jerusalem which opened in and was among its first board of governors earlier in he was asked by the biochemist and president of the world zionist organization chaim weizmann to help raise funds for the planned university he also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs among those he advised first creating an institute of agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land that should be followed he suggested by chemical institute and an institute of microbiology to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria which he called an evil that was undermining third of the country development establishing an oriental studies institute to include language courses given in both hebrew and arabic for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments was also important chaim weizmann later became israel first president upon his death while in office in november and at the urging of ezriel carlebach prime minister david ben gurion offered einstein the position of president of israel mostly ceremonial post the offer was presented by israel ambassador in washington abba eban who explained that the offer embodies the deepest respect which the jewish people can repose in any of its sons einstein declined and wrote in his response that he was deeply moved and at once saddened and ashamed that he could not accept it love of music einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age and later wrote if were not physicist would probably be musician often think in music live my daydreams in music see my life in terms of music get most joy in life out of music his mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin not only to instill in him love of music but also to help him assimilate into german culture according to conductor leon botstein einstein is said to have begun playing when he was although he did not enjoy it at that age when he turned he discovered the violin sonatas of mozart whereupon einstein fell in love with mozart music and studied music more willingly he taught himself to play without ever practicing systematically he said deciding that love is better teacher than sense of duty at age he was heard by school examiner in aarau as he played beethoven violin sonatas the examiner stating afterward that his playing was remarkable and revealing of great insight what struck the examiner writes botstein was that einstein displayed deep love of the music quality that was and remains in short supply music possessed an unusual meaning for this student music took on pivotal and permanent role in einstein life from that period on although the idea of becoming professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time among those with whom einstein played chamber music were few professionals and he performed for private audiences and friends chamber music had also become regular part of his social life while living in bern zürich and berlin where he played with max planck and his son among others he is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the edition of the köchel catalogue of mozart work that edition was prepared by alfred einstein who may have been distant relation in while engaged in research at the california institute of technology he visited the zoellner family conservatory in los angeles where he played some of beethoven and mozart works with members of the zoellner quartet near the end of his life when the young juilliard quartet visited him in princeton he played his violin with them and the quartet was impressed by einstein level of coordination and intonation political and religious views albert einstein with his wife elsa einstein and zionist leaders including future president of israel chaim weizmann his wife vera weizmann menahem ussishkin and ben zion mossinson on arrival in new york city in einstein political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism which he detailed in his essays such as why socialism einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics he strongly advocated the idea of democratic global government that would check the power of nation states in the framework of world federation the fbi created secret dossier on einstein in and by the time of his death his fbi file was pages long einstein spoke of his religious outlook in wide array of original writings and interviews einstein stated that he believed in the pantheistic god of baruch spinoza he did not believe in personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings view which he described as naïve he clarified however that am not an atheist preferring to call himself an agnostic or deeply religious nonbeliever when asked if he believed in an afterlife einstein replied no and one life is enough for me death on april einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm which had previously been reinforced surgically by rudolph nissen in he took the draft of speech he was preparing for television appearance commemorating the state of israel seventh anniversary with him to the hospital but he did not live long enough to complete it einstein refused surgery saying want to go when want it is tasteless to prolong life artificially have done my share it is time to go will do it elegantly he died in princeton hospital early the next morning at the age of having continued to work until near the end during the autopsy the pathologist of princeton hospital thomas stoltz harvey removed einstein brain for preservation without the permission of his family in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made einstein so intelligent einstein remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location in memorial lecture delivered on december at unesco headquarters nuclear physicist robert oppenheimer summarized his impression of einstein as person he was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness there was always with him wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn scientific career throughout his life einstein published hundreds of books and articles he published more than scientific papers and non scientific ones on december universities and archives announced the release of einstein papers comprising more than unique documents einstein intellectual achievements and originality have made the word einstein synonymous with genius in addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the bose einstein statistics the einstein refrigerator and others annus mirabilis papers the annus mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect which gave rise to quantum theory brownian motion the special theory of relativity and mc that einstein published in the annalen der physik scientific journal in these four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space time and matter the four papers are title translated area of focus received published significance on heuristic viewpoint concerning the production and transformation of light photoelectric effect march june resolved an unsolved puzzle by suggesting that energy is exchanged only in discrete amounts quanta this idea was pivotal to the early development of quantum theory on the motion of small particles suspended in stationary liquid as required by the molecular kinetic theory of heat brownian motion may july explained empirical evidence for the atomic theory supporting the application of statistical physics on the electrodynamics of moving bodies special relativity june september reconciled maxwell equations for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics by introducing major changes to mechanics close to the speed of light resulting from analysis based on empirical evidence that the speed of light is independent of the motion of the observer discredited the concept of luminiferous ether does the inertia of body depend upon its energy content matter energy equivalence september november equivalence of matter and energy and by implication the ability of gravity to bend light the existence of rest energy and the basis of nuclear energy thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics einstein first paper submitted in to annalen der physik was on capillary attraction it was published in with the title folgerungen aus den which translates as conclusions from the capillarity phenomena two papers he published in thermodynamics attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from statistical point of view these papers were the foundation for the paper on brownian motion which showed that brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist his research in and was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena general principles he articulated the principle of relativity this was understood by hermann minkowski to be generalization of rotational invariance from space to space time other principles postulated by einstein and later vindicated are the principle of equivalence general covariance and the principle of adiabatic invariance of the quantum number theory of relativity and mc einstein zur elektrodynamik bewegter körper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies was received on june and published september of that same year it reconciles maxwell equations for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics by introducing major changes to mechanics close to the speed of light this later became known as einstein special theory of relativity consequences of this include the time space frame of moving body appearing to slow down and contract in the direction of motion when measured in the frame of the observer this paper also argued that the idea of luminiferous aether one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time was superfluous in his paper on mass energy equivalence einstein produced mc from his special relativity equations einstein work on relativity remained controversial for many years but was accepted by leading physicists starting with max planck photons and energy quanta the photoelectric effect incoming photons on the left strike metal plate bottom and eject electrons depicted as flying off to the right in paper einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles quanta einstein light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists including max planck and niels bohr this idea only became universally accepted in with robert millikan detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect and with the measurement of compton scattering einstein concluded that each wave of frequency is associated with collection of photons with energy hf each where is planck constant he does not say much more because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave but he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results notably the photoelectric effect quantized atomic vibrations in einstein proposed model of matter where each atom in lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator in the einstein model each atom oscillates independently series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics peter debye refined this model adiabatic principle and action angle variables throughout the quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems after ernest rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets niels bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by planck and developed by einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms and the periodic table of the elements einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the arguments wilhelm wien had made wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by simple shifting process einstein noted in that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant arnold sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics wave particle duality einstein during his visit to the united states although the patent office promoted einstein to technical examiner second class in he had not given up on academia in he became privatdozent at the university of bern in über die entwicklung unserer anschauungen über das wesen und die konstitution der strahlung the development of our views on the composition and essence of radiation on the quantization of light and in an earlier paper einstein showed that max planck energy quanta must have well defined momenta and act in some respects as independent point like particles this paper introduced the photon concept although the name photon was introduced later by gilbert lewis in and inspired the notion of wave particle duality in quantum mechanics einstein saw this wave particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed new unified foundation theory of critical opalescence einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations giving treatment of the density variations in fluid at its critical point ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density at the critical point this derivative is zero leading to large fluctuations the effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered making the fluid look milky white einstein relates this to rayleigh scattering which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength and which explains why the sky is blue einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from treatment of density fluctuations and demonstrated how both the effect and rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter zero point energy in series of works completed from to planck reformulated his quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero point energy in his second quantum theory soon this idea attracted the attention of einstein and his assistant otto stern assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero point energy they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data the numbers matched nicely however after publishing the findings they promptly withdrew their support because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero point energy general relativity and the equivalence principle eddington photograph of solar eclipse general relativity gr is theory of gravitation that was developed by einstein between and according to general relativity the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses general relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape as einstein later said the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory while theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion even accelerated ones should appear more satisfactory consequently in he published an article on acceleration under special relativity in that article titled on the relativity principle and the conclusions drawn from it he argued that free fall is really inertial motion and that for free falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply this argument is called the equivalence principle in the same article einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation gravitational red shift and deflection of light in einstein published another article on the influence of gravitation on the propagation of light expanding on the article in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies thus the theoretical prediction of general relativity can for the first time be tested experimentally gravitational waves in einstein predicted gravitational waves ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves traveling outward from the source transporting energy as gravitational radiation the existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its lorentz invariance which brings the concept of finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it by contrast gravitational waves cannot exist in the newtonian theory of gravitation which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed the first indirect detection of gravitational waves came in the through observation of pair of closely orbiting neutron stars psr the explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves einstein prediction was confirmed on february when researchers at ligo published the first observation of gravitational waves on earth exactly one hundred years after the prediction hole argument and entwurf theory while developing general relativity einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory he formulated an argument that led him to conclude that general relativistic field theory is impossible he gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only in june the entwurf draft theory was the result of these investigations as its name suggests it was sketch of theory less elegant and more difficult than general relativity with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions after more than two years of intensive work einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in november physical cosmology in einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as whole he discovered that the general field equations predicted universe that was dynamic either contracting or expanding as observational evidence for dynamic universe was not known at the time einstein introduced new term the cosmological constant to the field equations in order to allow the theory to predict static universe the modified field equations predicted static universe of closed curvature in accordance with einstein understanding of mach principle in these years this model became known as the einstein world or einstein static universe following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by edwin hubble in einstein abandoned his static model of the universe and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos the friedmann einstein universe of and the einstein de sitter universe of in each of these models einstein discarded the cosmological constant claiming that it was in any case theoretically unsatisfactory in many einstein biographies it is claimed that einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his biggest blunder the astrophysicist mario livio has recently cast doubt on this claim suggesting that it may be exaggerated in late team led by the irish physicist cormac raifeartaigh discovered evidence that shortly after learning of hubble observations of the recession of the nebulae einstein considered steady state model of the universe in hitherto overlooked manuscript apparently written in early einstein explored model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to continuous creation of matter process he associated with the cosmological constant as he stated in the paper in what follows would like to draw attention to solution to equation that can account for hubbel sic facts and in which the density is constant over time if one considers physically bounded volume particles of matter will be continually leaving it for the density to remain constant new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space it thus appears that einstein considered steady state model of the expanding universe many years before hoyle bondi and gold however einstein steady state model contained fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea modern quantum theory newspaper headline on may einstein was displeased with quantum theory and quantum mechanics theory he had helped create despite its acceptance by other physicists stating that god is not playing at dice einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of in at the height of his work on relativity einstein published an article in physikalische zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser this article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with planck distribution law if the emission of light into mode with photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode this paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws einstein discovered louis de broglie work and supported his ideas which were received skeptically at first in another major paper from this era einstein gave wave equation for de broglie waves which einstein suggested was the hamilton jacobi equation of mechanics this paper would inspire schrödinger work of bose einstein statistics in einstein received description of statistical model from indian physicist satyendra nath bose based on counting method that assumed that light could be understood as gas of particles einstein noted that bose statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles and submitted his translation of bose paper to the zeitschrift für physik einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications among them the bose einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures it was not until that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by eric allin cornell and carl wieman using ultra cooling equipment built at the nist jila laboratory at the university of colorado at boulder bose einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons einstein sketches for this project may be seen in the einstein archive in the library of the leiden university energy momentum pseudotensor general relativity includes dynamical spacetime so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum noether theorem allows these quantities to be determined from lagrangian with translation invariance but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of gauge symmetry the energy and momentum derived within general relativity by noether presecriptions do not make real tensor for this reason einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by choice of coordinates he maintained that the non covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in gravitational field this approach has been echoed by lev landau and evgeny lifshitz and others and has become standard the use of non covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in by erwin schrödinger and others unified field theory following his research on general relativity einstein entered into series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include as another aspect of single entity in he described his unified field theory in scientific american article titled on the generalized theory of gravitation although he continued to be lauded for his work einstein became increasingly isolated in his research and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful in his pursuit of unification of the fundamental forces einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces which were not well understood until many years after his death mainstream physics in turn largely ignored einstein approaches to unification einstein dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for theory of everything and in particular string theory where geometrical fields emerge in unified quantum mechanical setting wormholes in einstein collaborated with nathan rosen to produce model of wormhole often called einstein rosen bridges his motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as solution of gravitational field equations in line with the program outlined in the paper do gravitational fields play an important role in the constitution of the elementary particles these solutions cut and pasted schwarzschild black holes to make bridge between two patches if one end of wormhole was positively charged the other end would be negatively charged these properties led einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way einstein cartan theory einstein at his office university of berlin in order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part called the torsion this modification was made by einstein and cartan in the equations of motion the theory of general relativity has fundamental law the einstein equations which describe how space curves the geodesic equation which describes how particles move may be derived from the einstein equations since the equations of general relativity are non linear lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields like black hole would move on trajectory which is determined by the einstein equations themselves not by new law so einstein proposed that the path of singular solution like black hole would be determined to be geodesic from general relativity itself this was established by einstein infeld and hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum and by roy kerr for spinning objects other investigations einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned these pertain to force and other research collaboration with other scientists the solvay conference in brussels gathering of the world top physicists einstein is in the center in addition to longtime collaborators leopold infeld nathan rosen peter bergmann and others einstein also had some one shot collaborations with various scientists einstein de haas experiment einstein and de haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons nowadays known to be the spin in order to show this they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on torsion pendulum they confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate because the electron angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes this experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization schrödinger gas model einstein suggested to erwin schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of bose einstein gas by considering box then to each possible quantum motion of particle in box associate an independent harmonic oscillator quantizing these oscillators each level will have an integer occupation number which will be the number of particles in it this formulation is form of second quantization but it predates modern quantum mechanics erwin schrödinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of semiclassical ideal gas schrödinger urged einstein to add his name as co author although einstein declined the invitation einstein refrigerator in einstein and his former student leó szilárd co invented and in patented the einstein refrigerator this absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input on november was awarded to einstein and leó szilárd for the refrigerator their invention was not immediately put into commercial production and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the swedish company electrolux bohr versus einstein einstein and niels bohr the bohr einstein debates were series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between einstein and niels bohr who were two of its founders their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics einstein podolsky rosen paradox in einstein returned to the question of quantum mechanics he considered how measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other he noted along with his collaborators that by performing different measurements on the distant particle either of position or momentum different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any way he then used hypothesis of local realism to conclude that the other particle had these properties already determined the principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to position or momentum measurement would be without in any way disturbing the particle then the particle actually has values of position or momentum this principle distilled the essence of einstein objection to quantum mechanics as physical principle it was shown to be incorrect when the aspect experiment of confirmed bell theorem which had been promulgated in non scientific legacy while traveling einstein wrote daily to his wife elsa and adopted stepdaughters margot and ilse the letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the hebrew university margot einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death she died in einstein had expressed his interest in the plumbing profession and was made an honorary member of the plumbers and steamfitters union barbara wolff of the hebrew university albert einstein archives told the bbc that there are about pages of private correspondence written between and corbis successor to the roger richman agency licenses the use of his name and associated imagery as agent for the university in popular culture in the period before world war ii the new yorker published vignette in their the talk of the town feature saying that einstein was so well known in america that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain that theory he finally figured out way to handle the incessant inquiries he told his inquirers pardon me sorry always am mistaken for professor einstein einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels films plays and works of music he is favorite model for depictions of mad scientists and absent minded professors his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated time magazine frederic golden wrote

arabic calligraphy allah is the arabic word for god in abrahamic religions in the english language the word generally refers to god in islam the word is thought to be derived by contraction from al ilāh which means the god and is related to el and elah the hebrew and aramaic words for god the word allah has been used by arabic people of different religions since pre islamic times more specifically it has been used as term for god by muslims both arab and non arab and arab christians it is also often albeit not exclusively used in this way by bábists bahá ís indonesian and maltese christians and mizrahi jews similar usage by christians and sikhs in west malaysia has recently led to political and legal controversies etymology the arabic components that build up the word allah the etymology of the word allāh has been discussed extensively by classical arab philologists grammarians of the basra school regarded it as either formed spontaneously murtajal or as the definite form of lāh from the verbal root lyh with the meaning of lofty or hidden others held that it was borrowed from syriac or hebrew but most considered it to be derived from contraction of the arabic definite article al the and deity god to meaning the deity or the god the majority of modern scholars subscribe to the latter theory and view the loanword hypothesis with skepticism cognates of the name allāh exist in other semitic languages including hebrew and aramaic the corresponding aramaic form is elah but its emphatic state is elaha it is written as ʼĕlāhā in biblical aramaic and ʼalâhâ in syriac as used by the assyrian church both meaning simply god biblical hebrew mostly uses the plural but functional singular form elohim but more rarely it also uses the singular form eloah usage pre islamic arabians regional variants of the word allah occur in both pagan and christian pre islamic inscriptions different theories have been proposed regarding the role of allah in pre islamic polytheistic cults some authors have suggested that polytheistic arabs used the name as reference to creator god or supreme deity of their pantheon the term may have been vague in the meccan religion according to one hypothesis which goes back to julius wellhausen allah the supreme deity of the tribal federation around quraysh was designation that consecrated the superiority of hubal the supreme deity of quraysh over the other gods however there is also evidence that allah and hubal were two distinct deities according to that hypothesis the kaaba was first consecrated to supreme deity named allah and then hosted the pantheon of quraysh after their conquest of mecca about century before the time of muhammad some inscriptions seem to indicate the use of allah as name of polytheist deity centuries earlier but we know nothing precise about this use some scholars have suggested that allah may have represented remote creator god who was gradually eclipsed by more particularized local deities there is disagreement on whether allah played major role in the meccan religious cult no iconic representation of allah is known to have existed muhammad father name was meaning the slave of allāh christianity the aramaic word for god in the language of assyrian christians is ʼĕlāhā or alaha arabic speakers of all abrahamic faiths including christians and jews use the word allah to mean god the christian arabs of today have no other word for god than allah even the arabic descended maltese language of malta whose population is almost entirely roman catholic uses alla for god arab christians for example use the terms for god the father for god the son and for god the holy spirit see god in christianity for the christian concept of god arab christians have used two forms of invocations that were affixed to the beginning of their written works they adopted the muslim and also created their own trinitized as early as the th century the muslim reads in the name of god the compassionate the merciful the trinitized reads in the name of father and the son and the holy spirit one god the syriac latin and greek invocations do not have the words one god at the end this addition was made to emphasize the monotheistic aspect of trinitarian belief and also to make it more palatable to muslims according to marshall hodgson it seems that in the pre islamic times some arab christians made pilgrimage to the kaaba pagan temple at that time honoring allah there as god the creator some archaeological excavation quests have led to the discovery of ancient pre islamic inscriptions and tombs made by arab christians in the ruins of church at umm el jimal in northern jordan which contained references to allah as the proper name of god and some of the graves contained names such as abd allah which means the servant slave of allah the name allah can be found countless times in the reports and the lists of names of christian martyrs in south arabia as reported by antique syriac documents of the names of those martyrs from the era of the himyarite and aksumite kingdoms christian leader named abd allah ibn abu bakr ibn muhammad was martyred in najran in as he had worn ring that said allah is my lord in an inscription of christian martyrion dated back to references to allah can be found in both arabic and aramaic which called him allah and alaha and the inscription starts with the statement by the help of allah in pre islamic gospels the name used for god was allah as evidenced by some discovered arabic versions of the new testament written by arab christians during the pre islamic era in northern and southern arabia pre islamic arab christians have been reported to have raised the battle cry ya la ibad allah slaves of allah to invoke each other into battle allah was also mentioned in pre islamic christian poems by some ghassanid and tanukhid poets in syria and northern arabia islam medallion showing allah jalla jalaluhu in the hagia sophia istanbul turkey allah script outside eski cami the old mosque in edirne turkey in islam allah is the unique omnipotent and only deity and creator of the universe and is equivalent to god in other abrahamic religions according to islamic belief allah is the most common word to represent god and humble submission to his will divine ordinances and commandments is the pivot of the muslim faith he is the only god creator of the universe and the judge of humankind he is unique and inherently one all merciful and omnipotent the qur an declares the reality of allah his inaccessible mystery his various names and his actions on behalf of his creatures in islamic tradition there are names of god lit meaning the best names or the most beautiful names each of which evoke distinct characteristic of allah all these names refer to allah the supreme and all comprehensive divine name among the names of god the most famous and most frequent of these names are the merciful al raḥmān and the compassionate most muslims use the untranslated arabic phrase meaning if god wills after references to future events muslim discursive piety encourages beginning things with the invocation of meaning in the name of god there are certain phrases in praise of god that are favored by muslims including subḥān allāh holiness be to god al ḥamdu lillāh praise be to god there is no deity but god and allāhu akbar god is greater as devotional exercise of remembering god dhikr in sufi practice known as dhikr allah lit remembrance of god the sufi repeats and contemplates on the name allah or other divine names while controlling his or her breath according to gerhard böwering in contrast with pre islamic arabian polytheism god in islam does not have associates and companions nor is there any kinship between god and jinn pre islamic pagan arabs believed in blind powerful inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control this was replaced with the islamic notion of powerful but provident and merciful god according to francis edwards peters the qur ān insists muslims believe and historians affirm that muhammad and his followers worship the same god as the jews the qur an allah is the same creator god who covenanted with abraham peters states that the qur an portrays allah as both more powerful and more remote than yahweh and as universal deity unlike yahweh who closely follows israelites as loanword english and other european languages the history of the name allāh in english was probably influenced by the study of comparative religion in the th century for example thomas carlyle sometimes used the term allah but without any implication that allah was anything different from god however in his biography of muḥammad tor andræ always used the term allah though he allows that this conception of god seems to imply that it is different from that of the jewish and christian theologies languages which may not commonly use the term allah to denote god may still contain popular expressions which use the word for example because of the centuries long muslim presence in the iberian peninsula the word ojalá in the spanish language and oxalá in the portuguese language exist today borrowed from arabic arabic إن شاء الله this phrase literally means if god wills in the sense of hope so the german poet mahlmann used the form allah as the title of poem about the ultimate deity though it is unclear how much islamic thought he intended to convey some muslims leave the name allāh untranslated in english the word has also been applied to certain living human beings as of the term and concept malaysian and indonesian language ruyl justus heurnius and caspar wiltens in recorded allah as the translation of the dutch word godt gereja kalam kebangunan allah word of god revival church in indonesia allah is the word for god in indonesian language even in alkitab christian bible from الكتاب al kitāb the book translations while tuhan is the word for lord christians in malaysia also use the word allah for god christians in malaysia and indonesia use allah to refer to god in the malaysian and indonesian languages both of which are standardized forms of the malay language mainstream bible translations in the language use allah as the translation of hebrew elohim translated in english bibles as god this goes back to early translation work by francis xavier in the th century the first dictionary of dutch malay by albert cornelius ruyl justus heurnius and caspar wiltens in revised edition from edition and latin edition recorded allah as the translation of the dutch word godt ruyl also translated matthew in to malay language first bible translation to non european language only year after king james version was published which was printed in the netherlands in then he translated mark which was published in the government of malaysia in outlawed usage of the term allah in any other but muslim contexts but the malayan high court in revoked the law ruling that it was while allah had been used for the christian god in malay for more than four centuries the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage of allah by the roman catholic newspaper the herald the government appealed the court ruling and the high court suspended implementation of its verdict until the appeal was heard in october the court ruled in favor of the government ban in early the malaysian government confiscated more than bibles for using the word to refer to the christian god in peninsular malaysia however the use of allah is not prohibited in the two malaysian state of sabah and sarawak the main reason it is not prohibited in these two states is that usage has been long established and local alkitab bibles have been widely distributed freely in east malaysia without restrictions for years both states also do not have similar islamic state laws as those in west malaysia as reaction to some media criticism the malaysian government has introduced point solution to avoid confusion and misleading information the point solution is in line with the spirit of the and point agreements of sarawak and sabah in other

crossroads of eastern europe and western asia it is bound by the caspian sea to the east russia to the north georgia to the northwest armenia to the west and iran to the south the exclave of nakhchivan is bound by armenia to the north and east iran to the south and west and has an km long border with turkey in the north west the azerbaijan democratic republic proclaimed its independence in and became the first democratic state in the muslim oriented world the country was incorporated into the soviet union in as the azerbaijan soviet socialist republic the modern republic of azerbaijan proclaimed its independence on august prior to the official dissolution of the ussr in december in september the armenian majority of the disputed nagorno karabakh region seceded to form the republic of artsakh the region and seven adjacent districts outside it became de facto independent with the end of the nagorno karabakh war in these regions are internationally recognized as part of azerbaijan pending solution to the status of the nagorno karabakh found through negotiations facilitated by the osce azerbaijan is unitary semi presidential republic the country is member state of the council of europe the osce and the nato partnership for peace pfp program it is one of six independent turkic states an active member of the turkic council and the türksoy community azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with countries and holds membership in international organizations it is one of the founding members of guam the commonwealth of independent states cis and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons member of the united nations since after its independence azerbaijan was elected to membership in the newly established human rights council by the united nations general assembly on may its term of office began on june azerbaijan is also member state of the non aligned movement holds observer status in world trade organization and is correspondent at the international union the constitution of azerbaijan does not declare an official religion and all major political forces in the country are secularist however the majority of the population are of shiite muslim background most azerbaijanis however do not actively practice any religion and the country has been seen to be one of the most irreligious countries in the muslim world with stating religion has little to no importance in their lives according to pew research center and gallup polls azerbaijan has high level of human development which ranks on par with most eastern european countries it has high rate of economic development and literacy as well as low rate of unemployment however the ruling party the new azerbaijan party has been accused of and human rights abuses etymology azerbaijan and its main cities according to modern etymology the name of azerbaijan derives from that of atropates persian satrap under the achaemenid empire who was later reinstated as the satrap of media under alexander the great the original etymology of this name is thought to have its roots in the once dominant zoroastrianism in the avesta frawardin yasht hymn to the guardian angels there is mention of âterepâtahe ashaonô fravashîm ýazamaide which literally translates from avestan as we worship the fravashi of the holy atropatene the name atropates itself is the greek transliteration of an old iranian probably median compounded name with the meaning protected by the holy fire or the land of the holy fire the greek name was mentioned by diodorus siculus and strabo over the span of millennia the name evolved to āturpātākān middle persian then to ādharbādhagān ādharbāyagān āzarbāydjān new persian and present day azerbaijan in the government of musavat adopted the name azerbaijan for the new azerbaijan democratic republic which was proclaimed on may for political reasons even though the name of azerbaijan had always been used to refer to the adjacent region of contemporary northwestern iran thus until when the musavat regime decided to name the newly independent state azerbaijan the designation had been used exclusively to identify the iranian province of azerbaijan during soviet rule the country was also spelled in english from the russian transliteration as azerbaydzhan history antiquity petroglyphs in gobustan national park dating back to the th millennium bc indicating thriving culture it is unesco world heritage site considered to be of outstanding universal value the earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of azerbaijan dates back to the late stone age and is related to the guruchay culture of azokh cave the upper paleolithic and late bronze age cultures are attested in the caves of tağılar damcılı zar yataq yeri and in the necropolises of leylatepe and saraytepe early settlements included the scythians in the th century bc following the scythians iranian medes came to dominate the area to the south of the aras the medes forged vast empire between bc which was integrated into the achaemenid empire around bc the area was conquered by the achaemenids leading to the spread of zoroastrianism later it became part of alexander the great empire and its successor the seleucid empire during this period zoroastrianism spread in the caucasus and atropatene caucasian albanians the original inhabitants of northeastern azerbaijan ruled that area from around the th century bc and established an independent kingdom from the sasanid period to the safavid period the sasanian empire turned caucasian albania into vassal state in while king urnayr officially adopted christianity as the state religion in the th century despite sassanid rule albania remained an entity in the region until the th century while fully subordinate to sassanid iran and retained its monarchy despite being one of the chief vassals of the sasanian emperor the albanian king had only semblance of authority and the sasanian marzban military governor held most civil religious and military authority in the first half of the th century caucasian albania as vassal of the sasanians came under nominal muslim rule due to the muslim conquest of persia the umayyad caliphate repulsed both the sasanians and byzantines from transcaucasia and turned caucasian albania into vassal state after christian resistance led by king javanshir was suppressed in the power vacuum left by the decline of the abbasid caliphate was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the sallarids sajids and shaddadids at the beginning of the th century the territory was gradually seized by waves of oghuz turks from central asia the first of these turkic dynasties established was the seljuk empire who entered the area now known as azerbaijan by the pre turkic population that lived on the territory of modern azerbaijan spoke several indo european and caucasian languages among them armenian and an iranian language old azeri which was gradually replaced by turkic language the early precursor of the azerbaijani language of today some linguists have also stated that the tati dialects of iranian azerbaijan and the republic of azerbaijan like those spoken by the tats are descended from old azeri locally the possessions of the subsequent seljuk empire were ruled by eldiguzids technically vassals of the seljuk sultans but sometimes de facto rulers themselves under the seljuks local poets such as nizami ganjavi and khaqani gave rise to blossoming of persian literature on the territory of present day azerbaijan the local dynasty of the shirvanshahs became vassal state of timur empire and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the golden horde tokhtamysh following timur death two independent and rival states emerged kara koyunlu and aq qoyunlu the shirvanshahs returned maintaining high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals from for numerous centuries to come in the safavid dynasty of iran subdued the shirvanshahs and gained its possessions in the course of the next century the safavids converted the formerly sunni population to shia islam as they did with the population in what is modern day iran the safavids allowed the shirvanshahs to remain in power under safavid suzerainty until when safavid king tahmasp completely deposed them and made the area into the safavid province of shirvan the sunni ottomans briefly managed to occupy parts of present day azerbaijan as result of the ottoman safavid war of by the early th century they were ousted by safavid iranian ruler abbas in the wake of the demise of the safavid empire baku and its environs were briefly occupied by the russians as consequence of the russo persian war of despite brief intermissions such as these by safavid iran neighboring rivals the land of what is today azerbaijan remained under iranian rule from the earliest advent of the safavids up to the course of the th century contemporary history territories of the khanates and sultanates in the th th century after the safavids the area was ruled by the iranian afsharid dynasty after the death of nader shah many of his former subjects capitalized on the eruption of instability numerous self ruling khanates with various forms of autonomy emerged in the area these rulers of these khanates were directly related to the ruling dynasties of iran and were vassals and subjects of the iranian shah the khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between central asia and the west thereafter the area was under the successive rule of the iranian zands and qajars from the late th century imperial russia switched to more aggressive geo political stance towards its two neighbors and rivals to the south namely iran and the ottoman empire russia now actively tried to gain possession of the caucasus region which was for the most part in the hands of iran in the russians invaded and sacked the iranian town of ganja sparking the russo persian war of militarily superior the russians ended the russo persian war of with victory the siege of ganja fortress in during the russo persian war of by russian forces under the leadership of general pavel tsitsianov following qajar iran loss in the war it was forced to concede suzerainty over most of the khanates along with georgia and dagestan to the russian empire per the treaty of gulistan the area to the north of the river aras amongst which territory lies the contemporary republic of azerbaijan was iranian territory until it was occupied by russia in the th century about decade later in violation of the gulistan treaty the russians invaded iran erivan khanate this sparked the final bout of hostilities between the two the russo persian war of the resulting treaty of turkmenchay forced qajar iran to cede sovereignty over the erivan khanate the nakhchivan khanate and the remainder of the lankaran khanate comprising the last parts of the soil of the contemporary azerbaijani republic that were still in iranian hands after incorporation of all caucasian territories from iran into russia the new border between the two was set at the aras river which upon the soviet union disintegration subsequently became part of the border between iran and the azerbaijan republic qajar iran was forced to cede its caucasian territories to russia in the th century which thus included the territory of the modern day azerbaijan republic while as result of that cession the azerbaijani ethnic group is nowadays parted between two nations iran and azerbaijan nevertheless the number of ethnic azerbaijanis in iran far outnumber those in neighbouring azerbaijan after the collapse of the russian empire during world war the short lived transcaucasian democratic federative republic was declared constituting what are the present day republics of azerbaijan georgia and armenia it was followed by the march days massacres that took place between march and april in the city of baku and adjacent areas of the baku governorate of the russian empire when the republic dissolved in may the leading musavat party declared independence as the azerbaijan democratic republic adr adopting the name of azerbaijan for the new republic name that prior to the proclamation of the adr was solely used to refer to the adjacent northwestern region of contemporary iran the adr was the first modern parliamentary republic in the muslim world among the important accomplishments of the parliament was the extension of suffrage to women making azerbaijan the first muslim nation to grant women equal political rights with men another important accomplishment of adr was the establishment of baku state university which was the first modern type university founded in the muslim east paris peace conference by march it was obvious that soviet russia would attack baku vladimir lenin said that the invasion was justified as soviet russia could not survive without baku oil independent azerbaijan lasted only months until the bolshevik th soviet red army invaded it establishing the azerbaijan ssr on april although the bulk of the newly formed azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an armenian revolt that had just broken out in karabakh azerbaijanis did not surrender their brief independence of quickly or easily as many as azerbaijani soldiers died resisting what was effectively russian reconquest on october the soviet republics of russia armenia azerbaijan and georgia signed an agreement with turkey known as the treaty of kars the previously independent republic of aras would also become the nakhichevan autonomous soviet socialist republic within the azerbaijan ssr by the treaty of kars on the other hand armenia was awarded the region of zangezur and turkey agreed to return gyumri then known as alexandropol during world war ii azerbaijan played crucial role in the strategic energy policy of the soviet union with percent of the soviet union oil on the eastern front being supplied by baku by the decree of the supreme soviet of the ussr in february the commitment of more than workers and employees of the oil industry of azerbaijan were awarded orders and medals operation edelweiss carried out by the german wehrmacht targeted baku because of its importance as the energy petroleum dynamo of the ussr fifth of all azerbaijanis fought in the second world war from to approximately people with over of them women went to the front while the total population of azerbaijan was million at the time some people from azerbaijan were killed on the front more than azerbaijanis were named heroes of the soviet union azerbaijani major general azi aslanov was twice awarded the hero of the soviet union independence red army paratroops during the black january tragedy in following the politics of glasnost initiated by mikhail gorbachev civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the soviet union including nagorno karabakh an autonomous region of the azerbaijan ssr the disturbances in azerbaijan in response to moscow indifference to an already heated conflict resulted in calls for independence and secession which culminated in the black january events in baku later in the supreme council of the azerbaijan ssr dropped the words soviet socialist from the title adopted the declaration of sovereignty of the azerbaijan republic and restored the flag of the azerbaijan democratic republic as the state flag as consequence of the failed coup which occurred in august in moscow on october the supreme council of azerbaijan adopted declaration of independence which was affirmed by nationwide referendum in december while the soviet union officially ceased to exist on december the early years of independence were overshadowed by the nagorno karabakh war with the ethnic armenian majority of nagorno karabakh backed by armenia by the end of the hostilities in armenians controlled up to percent of azerbaijani territory including nagorno karabakh itself during the war many atrocities were committed including the massacres at malibeyli and gushchular the garadaghly massacre the agdaban and the khojaly massacres furthermore an estimated people have been killed and more than million people have been displaced four united nations security council resolutions and demand for the immediate withdrawal of all armenian forces from all occupied territories of azerbaijan many russians and armenians left azerbaijan during the according to the census there were ethnic russians and armenians in azerbaijan in democratically elected

agnostida is an order of arthropod which first developed near the end of the early cambrian period and thrived during the middle cambrian they are present in the lower cambrian fossil record along with trilobites from the redlichiida corynexochida and ptychopariida orders the last agnostids went extinct in the late ordovician systematics the agnostida are divided into two suborders agnostina and eodiscina that are then subdivided into number of families as group agnostids are isopygous meaning that their pygidium is similar in size and shape to their cephalon most agnostid species were eyeless the systematic position of the order agnostida within the class trilobita remains uncertain and there has been continuing debate whether they are trilobites or stem group the challenge to the status has focused on the agnostina partly because juveniles of one genus have been found with legs greatly different from those of adult trilobites suggesting they are not members of the lamellipedian clade of which trilobites are part instead the limbs of agnostids closely resemble those of stem group crustaceans although they lack the proximal endite which defines that group they are likely the sister taxon to the crustacean stem lineage and as such part of the clade crustaceomorpha other researchers have suggested based on cladistic analyses of dorsal exoskeletal features that eodiscina and agnostida are closely united and that the eodiscina descended from the trilobite order ptychopariida ecology scientists have long debated whether the agnostids lived pelagic or benthic lifestyle their lack of eyes morphology not well suited for swimming and their fossils found in association with other benthic trilobites all suggest benthic bottom dwelling mode of life they are likely to have lived on areas of the ocean floor that received little or no light and fed on detritus that descended from upper layers of the sea to the bottom in contrast their wide geographic dispersion in the fossil record is of benthic animals suggesting pelagic existence the thoracic segment appears to form hinge between the head and pygidium allowing for bivalved ostracodan type lifestyle furthermore the orientation of the thoracic appendages appears ill suited for benthic living however recent work suggests that some agnostids were benthic predators engaging in cannibalism and possibly manifesting pack hunting behavior they are sometimes preserved within the voids of other organisms for instance within empty hyolith conchs within sponges worm tubes and under the carapaces of bivalved arthropods presumably in order to hide from predators or strong storm currents or maybe whilst scavenging for food in the case of the tapering worm tubes selkirkia trilobites are always found with their heads directed towards the opening of the tube suggesting that they reversed in the absence of any moulted carapaces suggests that moulting was not their primary reason for seeking shelter references external links order agnostida by sam gon iii the virtual fossil museum trilobite order agnostida agnostida fact sheet by sam gon iii earth early cannibals caught in the act by larry hanlon news discovery com
alfred habdank skarbek korzybski july march was polish american independent scholar who developed field called general semantics which he viewed as both distinct from and more encompassing than the field of semantics he argued that human knowledge of the world is limited both by the human nervous system and the languages humans have developed and thus no one can have direct access to reality given that the most we can know is that which is filtered through the brain responses to reality his best known dictum is the map is not the territory early life and career alfred korzybski family coat of arms see abdank coat of arms korzybski was born in warsaw poland which at that time was part of the russian empire he was part of an aristocratic polish family whose members had worked as mathematicians scientists and engineers for generations he learned the polish language at home and the russian language in schools and having french governess and german governess he became fluent in these four languages as child korzybski was educated at the warsaw university of technology in engineering during the first world war korzybski served as an intelligence officer in the russian army after being wounded in leg and suffering other injuries he moved to north america in first to canada then the united states to coordinate the shipment of artillery to russia he also lectured to polish american audiences about the conflict promoting the sale of war bonds after the war he decided to remain in the united states becoming naturalized citizen in he met mira edgerly painter of portraits on ivory shortly after the armistice and married her in january their marriage lasted until his death his first book manhood of humanity was published in in the book he proposed and explained in detail new theory of humankind mankind as time binding class of life humans perform time binding by the transmission of knowledge and abstractions through time which are accreted in cultures general semantics korzybski work culminated in the initiation of discipline that he named general semantics gs this should not be confused with semantics the basic principles of general semantics which include time binding are described in the publication science and sanity published in in korzybski founded the institute of general semantics in chicago the post world war ii housing shortage in chicago cost him the institute building lease so in he moved the institute to lakeville connecticut where he directed it until his death in korzybski maintained that humans are limited in what they know by the structure of their nervous systems and the structure of their languages humans cannot experience the world directly but only through their abstractions nonverbal impressions or gleanings derived from the nervous system and verbal indicators expressed and derived from language these sometimes mislead us about what is the case our understanding sometimes lacks similarity of structure with what is actually happening he sought to train our awareness of abstracting using techniques he had derived from his study of mathematics and science he called this awareness this goal of his system consciousness of abstracting his system included the promotion of attitudes such as don know let see in order that we may better discover or reflect on its realities as revealed by modern science another technique involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet an experience he termed silence on the objective levels to be many devotees and critics of korzybski reduced his rather complex system to simple matter of what he said about the verb form is of the more general verb to be his system however is based primarily on such terminology as the different orders of abstraction and formulations such as consciousness of abstracting it is often said that korzybski opposed the use of the verb to be this is profound exaggeration he thought that certain uses of the verb to be called the is of identity and the is of predication were faulty in structure statement such as elizabeth is fool said of person named elizabeth who has done something that we regard as foolish in korzybski system one assessment of elizabeth belongs to higher order of abstraction than elizabeth herself korzybski remedy was to deny identity in this example to be aware continually that elizabeth is not what we call her we find elizabeth not in the verbal domain the world of words but the nonverbal domain the two he said amount to different orders of abstraction this was expressed by korzybski most famous premise the map is not the territory note that this premise uses the phrase is not form of to be this and many other examples show that he did not intend to abandon to be as such in fact he said explicitly that there were no structural problems with the verb to be when used as an auxiliary verb or when used to state existence or location it was even acceptable at times to use the faulty forms of the verb to be as long as one was aware of their structural limitations anecdotes one day korzybski was giving lecture to group of students and he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve packet of biscuits wrapped in white paper from his briefcase he muttered that he just had to eat something and he asked the students on the seats in the front row if they would also like biscuit few students took biscuit nice biscuit don you think said korzybski while he took second one the students were chewing vigorously then he tore the white paper from the biscuits in order to reveal the original packaging on it was big picture of dog head and the words dog cookies the students looked at the package and were shocked two of them wanted to vomit put their hands in front of their mouths and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet you see korzybski remarked have just demonstrated that people don just eat food but also words and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter william burroughs went to korzybski workshop in the autumn of he was years old and paid his fellow students there were in all included young samuel hayakawa later to become republican member of the senate ralph moriarty debit later to become the spiritual teacher vitvan and wendell johnson founder of the monster study influence korzybski was well received in numerous disciplines as evidenced by the positive reactions from leading figures in the sciences and humanities in the and as reported in the third edition of science and sanity in world war ii the us army used korzybski system to treat battle fatigue in europe under the supervision of dr douglas kelley who went on to become the psychiatrist in charge of recuperating the jewish prisoners at

sales grew from to an average annual growth rate of the apple ii also invented by wozniak was introduced on april at the first west coast computer faire it differed from its major rivals the trs and commodore pet because of its character cell based color graphics and open architecture while early apple ii models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices they were superseded by the introduction of inch floppy disk drive and interface called the disk ii the apple ii was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first killer app of the business world visicalc spreadsheet program

graphical user interface gui and development of gui began for the apple lisa in however he was pushed from the lisa team due to infighting jobs took over jef raskin low cost computer project the macintosh race broke out between the lisa team and the macintosh team over which product would ship first lisa won the race in and became the first personal computer sold to the public with gui but was commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles on december apple went public at per share generating more capital than any ipo since ford motor company in and immediately creating millionaires success with macintosh the macintosh released in was the first mass market personal computer that featured an integral graphical user interface and mouse in apple launched the macintosh the first personal computer to be sold without programming language its debut was signified by million television commercial directed by ridley scott that aired during the third quarter of super bowl xviii on january the commercial is now hailed as watershed event for apple success and was called masterpiece by cnn and one of the greatest commercials of all time by tv guide the macintosh initially sold well but follow up sales were not strong due to its high price and limited range of software titles the machine fortunes changed with the introduction of the laserwriter the first postscript laser printer to be sold at reasonable price and pagemaker an early desktop publishing package it has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market the macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive macintosh gui in power struggle developed between jobs and ceo john sculley who had been hired two years earlier the apple board of directors instructed sculley to contain jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products rather than submit to sculley direction jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at apple sculley found out that jobs

right policy named for the position on chart of price vs profits jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for price for the macintosh which they were unable to meet newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in power although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market the high right policy was in full force by the mid notably due to jean louis gassée mantra of fifty five or die referring to the profit margins of the macintosh ii this policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on pc clones that offered some or much of the same functionality of the macintosh but at far lower price points the company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high priced products the christmas season of was the first in the company history that saw declining sales and led to drop in apple stock price gassée objections were overruled and he was forced from the company in later that year apple introduced three lower cost models the macintosh classic macintosh lc and macintosh iisi all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand in apple introduced the powerbook replacing the luggable macintosh portable with design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops the same year apple introduced system major upgrade to the operating system

universities with the most alumni at apple apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after apple became fortune company by the time of the television commercial apple informal culture had become key trait that differentiated it from its competitors according to report in fortune this has resulted in corporate culture more akin to startup rather than multinational corporation as the company has grown and been led by series of differently opinionated chief executives it has arguably lost some of its original character nonetheless it has maintained reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers particularly after jobs returned to the company numerous apple employees have stated that projects without jobs involvement often took longer than projects with it to recognize the best of its employees apple created the apple fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company the apple fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including bill atkinson steve capps rod holt alan kay guy kawasaki al alcorn don norman rich page and steve wozniak steve wozniak and andy hertzfeld in at apple employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise jobs saw this as means of having best in class employees in every role for instance ron johnson senior vice president of retail operations until november was responsible for site selection in store service and store layout yet had no control of the inventory in his stores this was done by cook who had background in supply chain management apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability each project has directly responsible individual or dri in apple jargon as an example when ios senior vice president scott forstall refused to sign apple official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned maps app he was forced to resign unlike other major companies apple provides relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other ceos like country club fees or private use of company aircraft the company typically grants stock options to executives every other year in apple had full time employees this increased to full time employees the next year notable hiring decrease largely due to its first revenue decline apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail though its sec filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base in september apple announced that it had over full time employees apple has strong culture of corporate secrecy and has an anti leak global security team that recruits from the national security agency the federal bureau of investigation and the united states secret service in december glassdoor named facebook the best place to work according to reviews from anonymous employees with apple dropping to th place having originally entered at rank in peaking at rank in and falling down the ranks in subsequent years lack of innovation an editorial article in the verge in september by technology journalist thomas ricker explored some of the public perceived lack of innovation at apple in recent years specifically stating that samsung has matched and even surpassed apple in terms of smartphone industrial design and citing the belief that apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products he goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as whole stating yes iteration is boring but it also how apple does business it enters new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields success he acknowledges that people are wishing for the excitement of revolution but argues that people want the comfort that comes with harmony furthermore he writes that device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without proper ecosystem specifically mentioning that walkman didn have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along but how apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the icloud cloud service with features including universal clipboard in which text copied on one device can be pasted on different device as well as inter connected device functionality including auto unlock in which an apple watch can unlock mac in close proximity he argues that apple ecosystem is its greatest innovation the wall street journal reported in june that apple increased reliance on siri its virtual personal assistant has raised questions about how much apple can actually accomplish in terms of functionality whereas google and amazon make use of big data and analyze customer information to personalize results apple has strong pro privacy stance intentionally not retaining user data siri is textbook of leading on something in tech and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in silicon valley holger mueller technology analyst told the journal the report further claims that development on siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors lack of ambitious goals and shifting strategies despite switching siri functions to machine learning and algorithms which dramatically cut its error rate the company reportedly still failed to anticipate the popularity of amazon echo which features the alexa personal assistant improvements to siri stalled executives clashed and there were disagreements over the restrictions imposed on third party app interactions while apple acquired an england based startup specializing in conversational assistants google assistant had already become capable of helping users select wi fi networks by voice and siri was lagging in functionality in december two articles from the verge and zdnet debated what had been particularly devastating week for apple macos and ios software platforms the former had experienced severe security vulnerability in which macs running the then latest macos high sierra software were vulnerable to bug that let anyone gain administrator privileges by entering root as the username in system prompts leaving the password field empty and twice clicking unlock gaining full access the bug was publicly disclosed on twitter rather than through proper bug bounty programs apple released security fix within day and issued an apology stating that regrettably we stumbled in regards to the security of the latest updates after installing the security patch however file sharing was broken for users with apple releasing support document with instructions to separately fix that issue despite its promise of auditing our development processes to help prevent this from happening again users who installed the security update while running the older version of the high sierra operating system rather than the then newest release experienced that the root security vulnerability was re introduced and persisted even after fully updating their systems on ios date bug caused ios devices that received local app notifications at am on december to repeatedly restart users were recommended to turn off notifications for their apps apple quickly released an update done during the nighttime in cupertino california time and outside of their usual software release window with one of the headlining features of the update needing to be delayed for few days the combined problems of the week on both macos and ios caused the verge tom warren to call it nightmare for apple software engineers and described it as significant lapse in apple ability to protect its more than billion devices zdnet adrian kingsley hughes wrote that it hard to not come away from the last week with the feeling that apple is slipping kingsley hughes also concluded his piece by referencing an earlier article in which he wrote that as much as don want to bring up the tired old apple wouldn have done this under steve jobs watch trope lot of what happening at apple lately is different from what came to expect under jobs not to say that things didn go wrong under his watch but product announcements and launches felt lot tighter for sure as did the overall quality of what apple was releasing he did however also acknowledge that such failures may indeed have happened with jobs in charge though returning to the previous praise for jobs quality stating it almost guaranteed that given his personality that heads would have rolled which limits future failures manufacturing the company manufacturing procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large profit sapping inventories in apple profit margins were percent compared with between and percent for most other hardware companies cook catchphrase to describe his focus on the company operational arm is nobody wants to buy sour milk during the mac early history apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware instead creating their own this trend was largely reversed in the late beginning with apple adoption of the pci bus in the power macs apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as usb agp hypertransport wi fi nvme pcie and others in its products firewire is an apple originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as ieee and is legally mandated port in all cable tv boxes in the united states apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the indian market in july during conference call with investors ceo tim cook said that he loves india but that apple saw larger opportunities outside the region india requirement that of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as really adds cost to getting product to market in october indian apple executives unveiled plan for selling devices through instalment plans and store within store concepts in an effort to expand further into the market the news followed cook acknowledgment of the country in july when sales results showed that iphone sales in india grew during the second quarter of in march the times of india reported that apple had sought permission from the indian government to sell refurbished iphones in the country however two months later the application was rejected citing official country policy in may apple opened an ios app development center in bangalore and maps development office for staff in hyderabad in february apple once again requested permission to sell used iphones in the country the same month bloomberg reported that apple was close to receiving permission to open its first retail store in the country in march the wall street journal reported that apple would begin manufacturing iphone models in india over the next two months and in may the journal wrote that an apple manufacturer had begun production of iphone se in the country while apple told cnbc that the manufacturing was for small number of units reuters reported in december that apple and the indian government were clashing over planned increases to import taxes for components used in mobile phone production with apple having engaged in talks with government officials to try to delay the plans but the indian government sticking to its policies of no exemptions to its made in india initiative the import tax increases went into effect few days later with apple being hurt the most out of all phone manufacturers having nine of out ten phones imported into the country whereas main smartphone competitor samsung produces almost all of its devices locally in may the company announced billion funding project for advanced manufacturing in the united states and subsequently invested million in corning inc manufacturer of toughened gorilla glass technology used in its iphone devices the following december apple chief operating officer jeff williams told cnbc that the billion amount was absolutely not the final limit on its spending elaborating that we re not thinking in terms of fund limit we re thinking about where are the opportunities across the to help nurture companies that are making the advanced technology and the advanced manufacturing that goes with that that quite frankly is essential to our innovation labor practices the company advertised its products as being made in america until the late however as result of outsourcing initiatives in the almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad according to report by the new york times apple insiders believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their american counterparts that made in the is no longer viable option for most apple products in the mail on sunday reported on the working conditions of the chinese factories where contract manufacturers foxconn and inventec produced the ipod the article stated that one complex of factories that assembled the ipod and other items had over workers

suppliers labor practices were published in early foxconn was not specifically named in the report but apple identified series of serious labor violations of labor laws including apple own rules and some child labor existed in number of factories apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides also in workers in china planned to sue iphone contractors over poisoning by cleaner used to clean lcd screens one worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses after high suicide rate in foxconn facility in china making ipads and iphones albeit lower rate than that of china as whole workers were forced to sign legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves workers in factories producing apple products have also been exposed to hexane neurotoxin that is cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products bbc investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted despite apple promise to reform factory practice after the foxconn suicides the pegatron factory was once again the subject of review as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees while the bbc maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since apple publicly disagreed with the bbc and stated we are aware of no other company doing as much as apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions in december the institute for global labour and human rights published report which documented inhumane conditions for the workers at zhen ding technology factory in shenzhen china which serves as major supplier of circuit boards for apple iphone and ipad according to the report workers are pressured

continents sidestepping income taxes in the late apple was pioneer of an accounting technique known as the double irish with dutch sandwich which reduces taxes by routing profits through irish subsidiaries and the netherlands and then to the caribbean british conservative party member of parliament charlie elphicke published research on october which showed that some multinational companies including apple inc were making billions of pounds of profit in the uk but were paying an effective tax rate to the uk treasury of only percent well below standard corporation tax he followed this research by calling on the chancellor of the exchequer george osborne to force these multinationals which also included google and the coca cola company to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their uk revenues elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of uk tax it is matter of public record that apple inc is the single largest taxpayer to the department of the treasury of the united states of america with an effective tax rate of approximately of as of the second quarter of the apple fiscal year in an

explicitly asked if they want to participate and can actively opt in or opt out that said apple aids law enforcement in criminal investigations by providing icloud backups of users devices and the

an abjad pronounced or is type of writing system where each symbol or glyph stands for consonant leaving the reader to supply the appropriate vowel the name abjad is based on the old arabic alphabet first four letters to replace the common terms consonantary consonantal alphabet or syllabary to refer to the family of scripts called west semitic etymology the name abjad is derived from pronouncing the first letters of the arabic alphabet in order the ordering of arabic letters used to match that of the older hebrew phoenician and semitic alphabets terminology according to the formulations of daniels abjads differ from alphabets in that only consonants not vowels are represented among the basic graphemes abjads differ from abugidas another category defined by daniels in that in abjads the vowel sound is implied by phonology and where vowel marks exist for the system such as nikkud for hebrew and ḥarakāt for arabic their use is optional and not the dominant or literate form abugidas mark the vowels other than the inherent vowel with diacritic minor attachment to the letter or standalone glyph some abugidas use special symbol to suppress the inherent vowel so that the consonant alone can be properly represented in syllabary grapheme denotes complete syllable that is either lone vowel sound or combination of vowel sound with one or more consonant sounds the antagonism of abjad versus alphabet as it was formulated by daniels has been rejected by other scholars because abjad is also used as term not only for the arabic numeral system but which is most important in terms of historical grammatology also as term for the alphabetic device letter order of ancient northwest semitic scripts in opposition to the south arabian order this caused fatal effects on terminology in general and especially in ancient semitic philology also it suggests that consonantal alphabets in opposition to for instance the greek alphabet were not yet true alphabets and not yet entirely complete lacking something important to be fully working script system it has also been objected that as set of letters an alphabet is not the mirror of what should be there in language from phonemic or even phonological point of view rather it is the data stock of what provides maximum efficiency with least effort from semantic point of view origins specimen of proto sinaitic script containing phrase which may mean to baalat the line running from the upper left to lower right reads mt bclt the first abjad to gain widespread usage was the phoenician abjad unlike other contemporary scripts such as cuneiform and egyptian hieroglyphs the phoenician script consisted of only few dozen symbols this made the script easy to learn and seafaring phoenician merchants took the script wherever they went the phoenician abjad was radical simplification of phonetic writing since hieroglyphics required the writer to pick hieroglyph starting with the same sound that the writer wanted to write in order to write phonetically much as man yougana chinese characters or kanji used solely for phonetic use was used to represent japanese phonetically before the invention of kana phoenician gave rise to number of new writing systems including the greek alphabet and aramaic widely used abjad the greek alphabet evolved into the modern western alphabets such as latin and cyrillic while aramaic became the ancestor of many modern abjads and abugidas of asia impure abjads al ʻarabiyya meaning arabic an example of the arabic script which is an impure abjad impure abjads have characters for some vowels optional vowel diacritics or both the term pure abjad refers to scripts entirely lacking in vowel indicators however most modern abjads such as arabic hebrew aramaic and pahlavi are impure abjadsthat is they also contain symbols for some of the vowel phonemes although the said non diacritic vowel letters are also used to write certain consonants particularly approximants that sound similar to long vowels pure abjad is exemplified perhaps by very early forms of ancient phoenician though at some point at least by the th century bc it and most of the contemporary semitic abjads had begun to overload few of the consonant symbols with secondary function as vowel markers called matres lectionis this practice was at first rare and limited in scope but became increasingly common and more developed in later times addition of vowels in the th century bc the greeks adapted the phoenician script for use in their own language the phonetic structure of the greek language created too many ambiguities when the vowels went unrepresented so the script was modified they did not need letters for the guttural sounds represented by aleph he heth or ayin so these symbols were assigned vocalic values the letters waw and yod were also adapted into vowel signs along with he these were already used as matres lectionis in phoenician the major innovation of greek was to dedicate these symbols exclusively and unambiguously to vowel sounds that could be combined arbitrarily with consonants as opposed to syllabaries such as linear which usually have vowel symbols but cannot combine them with consonants to form arbitrary syllables abugidas developed along slightly different route the basic consonantal symbol was considered to have an inherent vowel sound hooks or short lines attached to various parts of the basic letter modify the vowel in this way the south arabian alphabet evolved into the ge ez alphabet between the th century bc and the th century ad similarly around the rd century bc the brāhmī script developed from the aramaic abjad it has been hypothesized the other major family of abugidas canadian aboriginal syllabics was initially developed in the by missionary and linguist james evans for the cree and ojibwe languages evans used features of devanagari script and pitman shorthand to create his initial abugida later in the th century other missionaries adapted evans system to other canadian aboriginal languages canadian syllabics differ from other abugidas in that the vowel is indicated by rotation of the consonantal symbol with each vowel having consistent orientation abjads and the structure of semitic languages the abjad form of writing is well adapted to the morphological structure of the semitic languages it was developed to write this is because words in semitic languages are formed from root consisting of usually three consonants the vowels being used to indicate inflectional or derived forms for instance according to classical arabic and modern standard arabic from the arabic root dh to slaughter can be derived the forms he slaughtered you masculine singular slaughtered he slaughters and slaughterhouse in most cases the absence of full glyphs for vowels makes the common root clearer allowing readers to guess the meaning of unfamiliar words from familiar roots especially in conjunction with context clues and improving word

an atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of chemical element every solid liquid gas and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms atoms are very small typical sizes are around picometers ten billionth of meter in the short scale atoms are small enough that attempting to predict their behavior using classical physics as if they were billiard balls for example gives noticeably incorrect predictions due to quantum effects through the development of physics atomic models have incorporated quantum principles to better explain and predict the behavior every atom is composed of nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus the nucleus is made of one or more protons and typically similar number of neutrons protons and neutrons are called nucleons more than of an atom mass is in the nucleus the protons have positive electric charge the electrons have negative electric charge and the neutrons have no electric charge if the number of protons and electrons are equal that atom is electrically neutral if an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons then it has an overall negative or positive charge respectively and it is called an ion the electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by this electromagnetic force the protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by different force the nuclear force which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force repelling the positively charged protons from one another under certain circumstances the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus leaving behind different element nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation the number of protons in the nucleus defines to what chemical element the atom belongs for example all copper atoms contain protons the number of neutrons defines the isotope of the element the number of electrons influences the magnetic properties of an atom atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by chemical bonds to form chemical compounds such as molecules the ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature and is the subject of the discipline of chemistry history of atomic theory atoms in philosophy the idea that matter is made up of discrete units is very old idea appearing in many ancient cultures such as greece and india the word atom was coined by the ancient greek philosophers leucippus and his pupil democritus however these ideas were founded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence and experimentation as result their views on what atoms look like and how they behave were incorrect they also could not convince everybody so atomism was but one of number of competing theories on the nature of matter it was not until the th century that the idea was embraced and refined by scientists when the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries that only the concept of atoms could explain first evidence based theory various atoms and molecules as depicted in john dalton new system of chemical philosophy in the early john dalton used the concept of atoms to explain why elements always react in ratios of small whole numbers the law of multiple proportions for instance there are two types of tin oxide one is tin and oxygen and the other is tin and oxygen tin ii oxide and tin dioxide respectively this means that of tin will combine either with or of oxygen and form ratio of ratio of small whole numbers this common pattern in chemistry suggested to dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units in other words atoms in the case of tin oxides one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms dalton also believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbs different gases in different proportions for example he found that water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen dalton hypothesized this was due to the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases respective particles and carbon dioxide molecules co are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules brownian motion in botanist robert brown used microscope to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically phenomenon that became known as brownian motion this was thought to be caused by water molecules knocking the grains about in albert einstein proved the reality of these molecules and their motions by producing the first statistical physics analysis of brownian motion french physicist jean perrin used einstein work to experimentally determine the mass and dimensions of atoms thereby conclusively verifying dalton atomic theory discovery of the electron the geiger marsden experiment top expected results alpha particles passing through the plum pudding model of the atom with negligible deflection bottom observed results small portion of the particles were deflected by the concentrated positive charge of the nucleus the physicist thomson measured the mass of cathode rays showing they were made of particles but were around times lighter than the lightest atom hydrogen therefore they were not atoms but new particle the first subatomic particle to be discovered which he originally called corpuscle but was later named electron after particles postulated by george johnstone stoney in he also showed they were identical to particles given off by photoelectric and radioactive materials it was quickly recognized that they are the particles that carry electric currents in metal wires and carry the negative electric charge within atoms thomson was given the nobel prize in physics for this work thus he overturned the belief that atoms are the indivisible ultimate particles of matter thomson also incorrectly postulated that the low mass negatively charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom in uniform sea of positive charge this became known as the plum pudding model discovery of the nucleus in hans geiger and ernest marsden under the direction of ernest rutherford bombarded metal foil with alpha particles to observe how they scattered they expected all the alpha particles to pass straight through with little deflection because thomson model said that the charges in the atom are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the alpha particles much however geiger and marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than which was supposed to be impossible according to thomson model to explain this rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in tiny nucleus at the center of the atom rutherford compared his findings to one firing inch shell at sheet of tissue paper and it coming back to hit the person who fired it discovery of isotopes while experimenting with the products of radioactive decay in radiochemist frederick soddy discovered that there appeared to be more than one type of atom at each position on the periodic table the term isotope was coined by margaret todd as suitable name for different atoms that belong to the same element thomson created technique for separating atom types through his work on ionized gases which subsequently led to the discovery of stable isotopes bohr model the bohr model of the atom with an electron making instantaneous quantum leaps from one orbit to another this model is obsolete in the physicist niels bohr proposed model in which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only do so in finite set of orbits and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of photon this quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable given that normally charges in acceleration including circular motion lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation see synchrotron radiation and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra later in the same year henry moseley provided additional experimental evidence in favor of niels bohr theory these results refined ernest rutherford and antonius van den broek model which proposed that the atom contains in its nucleus number of positive nuclear charges that is equal to its atomic number in the periodic table until these experiments atomic number was not known to be physical and experimental quantity that it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today chemical bonding explained chemical bonds between atoms were now explained by gilbert newton lewis in as the interactions between their constituent electrons as the chemical properties of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law in the american chemist irving langmuir suggested that this could be explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner groups of electrons were thought to occupy set of electron shells about the nucleus further developments in quantum physics the stern gerlach experiment of provided further evidence of the quantum nature of the atom when beam of silver atoms was passed through specially shaped magnetic field the beam was split based on the direction of an atom angular momentum or spin as this direction is random the beam could be expected to spread into line instead the beam was split into two parts depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented up or down in louis de broglie proposed that all particles behave to an extent like waves in erwin schrödinger used this idea to develop mathematical model of the atom that described the electrons as three dimensional waveforms rather than point particles consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the position and momentum of particle at given point in time this became known as the uncertainty principle formulated by werner heisenberg in in this concept for given accuracy in measuring position one could only obtain range of probable values for momentum and vice versa this model was able to explain observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not such as certain structural and spectral patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen thus the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described atomic orbital zones around the nucleus where given electron is most likely to be observed discovery of the neutron the development of the mass spectrometer allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy the device uses magnet to bend the trajectory of beam of ions and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom mass to its charge the chemist francis william aston used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses the atomic mass of these isotopes varied by integer amounts called the whole number rule the explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the neutron an uncharged particle with mass similar to the proton by the physicist james chadwick in isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus fission high energy physics and condensed matter in the german chemist otto hahn student of rutherford directed neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting to get transuranium elements instead his chemical experiments showed barium as product year later lise meitner and her nephew otto frisch verified that hahn result were the first experimental nuclear fission in hahn received the nobel prize in chemistry despite hahn efforts the contributions of meitner and frisch were not recognized in the the development of improved particle accelerators and particle detectors allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies neutrons and protons were found to be hadrons or composites of smaller particles called quarks the standard model of particle physics was developed that so far has successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions structure subatomic particles though the word atom originally denoted particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of various subatomic particles the constituent particles of an atom are the electron the proton and the neutron all three are fermions however the hydrogen atom has no neutrons and the hydron ion has no electrons the electron is by far the least massive of these particles at with negative electrical charge and size that is too small to be measured using available techniques it is the lightest particle with positive rest mass measured under ordinary conditions electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges if an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as whole charged atom is called an ion electrons have been known since the late th century mostly thanks to thomson see history of subatomic physics for details protons have positive charge and mass times that of the electron at the number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number ernest rutherford observed that nitrogen under alpha particle bombardment ejects what appeared to be hydrogen nuclei by he had accepted that the hydrogen nucleus is distinct particle within the atom and named it proton neutrons have no electrical charge and have free mass of times the mass of the electron or the heaviest of the three constituent particles but it can be reduced by the nuclear binding energy neutrons and protons collectively known as nucleons have comparable dimensions on the order of although the surface of these particles is not sharply defined the neutron was discovered in by the english physicist james chadwick in the standard model of physics electrons are truly elementary particles with no internal structure however both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks there are two types of quarks in atoms each having fractional electric charge protons are composed of two up quarks each with charge and one down quark with charge of neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks this distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles the quarks are held together by the strong interaction or strong force which is mediated by gluons the protons and neutrons in turn are held to each other in the nucleus by the nuclear force which is residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range properties see the article on the nuclear force for more the gluon is member of the family of gauge bosons which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces nucleus the binding energy needed for nucleon to escape the nucleus for various isotopes all the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up tiny atomic nucleus and are collectively called nucleons the radius of nucleus is approximately equal to fm where is the total number of nucleons this is much smaller than the radius of the atom which is on the order of fm the nucleons are bound together by short ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force at distances smaller than fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other atoms of the same element have the same number of protons called the atomic number within single element the number of neutrons may vary determining the isotope of that element the total number of protons and neutrons determine the nuclide the number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus with certain isotopes undergoing radioactive decay the proton the electron and the neutron are classified as fermions fermions obey the pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical fermions such as multiple protons from occupying the same quantum state at the same time thus every proton in the nucleus must occupy quantum state different from all other protons and the same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud however proton and neutron are allowed to occupy the same quantum state for atoms with low atomic numbers nucleus that has more neutrons than protons tends to drop to lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutron proton ratio is closer to one however as the atomic number increases higher proportion of neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons thus there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number calcium and as increases the neutron proton ratio of stable isotopes increases the stable isotope with the highest proton neutron ratio is lead about illustration of nuclear fusion process that forms deuterium nucleus consisting of proton and neutron from two protons positron an antimatter electron is emitted along with an electron neutrino the number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be modified although this can require very high energies because of the strong force nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form heavier nucleus such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei for example at the core of the sun protons require energies of kev to overcome their mutual repulsion the coulomb barrier and fuse together into single nucleus nuclear fission is the opposite process causing nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei usually through radioactive decay the nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons if this modifies the number of protons in nucleus the atom changes to different chemical element if the mass of the nucleus following fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles then the difference between these two values can be emitted as type of usable energy such as gamma ray or the kinetic energy of beta particle as described by albert einstein mass energy equivalence formula mc where is the mass loss and is the speed of light this deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus and it is the non recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in state that requires this energy to separate the fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel total nucleon number of about is usually an exothermic process that releases more energy than is required to bring them together it is this energy releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars self sustaining reaction for heavier nuclei the binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease that means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about and atomic masses higher than about is an endothermic process these more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of star electron cloud potential well showing according to classical mechanics the minimum energy needed to reach each position classically particle with energy is constrained to range of positions between and the electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force this force binds the electrons inside an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape the closer an electron is to the nucleus the greater the attractive force hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations electrons like other particles have properties of both particle and wave the electron cloud is region inside the potential well where each electron forms type of three dimensional standing wave wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus this behavior is defined by an atomic orbital mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at particular location when its position is measured only discrete or quantized set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into more stable form orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures and differ from each other in size shape and orientation node that has an orientation and minimum at the center how atoms are constructed from electron orbitals and link to the periodic table each atomic orbital corresponds to particular energy level of the electron the electron can change its state to higher energy level by absorbing photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state likewise through spontaneous emission an electron in higher energy state can drop to lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as photon these characteristic energy values defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states are responsible for atomic spectral lines the amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron the electron binding energy is far less than the binding energy of nucleons for example it requires only ev to strip ground state electron from hydrogen atom compared to million ev for splitting deuterium nucleus atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons atoms that have either deficit or surplus of electrons are called ions electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms by this mechanism atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals properties nuclear properties by definition any two atoms with an identical number of protons in their nuclei belong to the same chemical element atoms with equal numbers of protons but different number of neutrons are different isotopes of the same element for example all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton but isotopes exist with no neutrons hydrogen by far the most common form also called protium one neutron deuterium two neutrons tritium and more than two neutrons the known elements form set of atomic numbers from the single proton element hydrogen up to the proton element oganesson all known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than are radioactive although the radioactivity of element bismuth is so slight as to be practically negligible about nuclides occur naturally on earth of which about have not been observed to decay and are referred to as stable isotopes however only of these nuclides are stable to all decay even in theory another bringing the total to have not been observed to decay even though in theory it is energetically possible these are also formally classified as stable an additional radioactive nuclides have half lives longer than million years and are long lived enough to be present from the birth of the solar system this collection of nuclides are known as primordial nuclides finally an additional short lived nuclides are known to occur naturally as daughter products of primordial nuclide decay such as radium from uranium or else as products of natural energetic processes on earth such as cosmic ray bombardment for example carbon for of the chemical elements at least one stable isotope exists as rule there is only handful of stable isotopes for each of these elements the average being stable isotopes per element twenty six elements have only single stable isotope while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten for the element tin elements and all elements numbered or higher have no stable isotopes stability of isotopes is affected by the ratio of protons to neutrons and also by the presence of certain magic numbers of neutrons or protons that represent closed and filled quantum shells these quantum shells correspond to set of energy levels within the shell model of the nucleus filled shells such as the filled shell of protons for tin confers unusual stability on the nuclide of the known stable nuclides only four have both an odd number of protons and odd number of neutrons hydrogen deuterium lithium boron and nitrogen also only four naturally occurring radioactive odd odd nuclides have half life over billion years potassium vanadium lanthanum and tantalum most odd odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay because the decay products are even even and are therefore more strongly bound due to nuclear pairing effects mass the large majority of an atom mass comes from the protons and neutrons that make it up the total number of these particles called nucleons in given atom is called the mass number it is positive integer and dimensionless instead of having dimension of mass because it expresses count an example of use of mass number is carbon which has nucleons six protons and six neutrons the actual mass of an atom at rest is often expressed using the unified atomic mass unit also called dalton da this unit is defined as twelfth of the mass of free neutral atom of carbon which is approximately hydrogen the lightest isotope of hydrogen which is also the nuclide with the lowest mass has an atomic weight of the value of this number is called the atomic mass given atom has an atomic mass approximately equal within to its mass number times the atomic mass unit for example the mass of nitrogen is roughly however this number will not be exactly an integer except in the case of carbon see below the heaviest stable atom is lead with mass of as even the most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly chemists instead use the unit of moles one mole of atoms of any element always has the same number of atoms about this number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of mole of atoms of that element has mass close to one gram because of the definition of the unified atomic mass unit each carbon atom has an atomic mass of exactly and so mole of carbon atoms weighs exactly kg shape and size atoms lack well defined outer boundary so their dimensions are usually described in terms of an atomic radius this is measure of the distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus however this assumes the atom to exhibit spherical shape which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in chemical bond the radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart the type of chemical bond the number of neighboring atoms coordination number and quantum mechanical property known as spin on the periodic table of the elements atom size tends to increase when moving down columns but decrease when moving across rows left to right consequently the smallest atom is helium with radius of pm while one of the largest is caesium at pm when subjected to external forces like electrical fields the shape of an atom may deviate from spherical symmetry the deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons as shown by group theoretical considerations aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in crystals where large crystal electrical fields may occur at low symmetry lattice sites significant ellipsoidal deformations have been shown to occur for sulfur ions and chalcogen ions in pyrite type compounds atomic dimensions are thousands of times smaller than the wavelengths of light nm so they cannot be viewed using an optical microscope however individual atoms can be observed using scanning tunneling microscope to visualize the minuteness of the atom consider that typical human hair is about million carbon atoms in width single drop of water contains about sextillion atoms of oxygen and twice the number of hydrogen atoms single carat diamond with mass of contains about sextillion atoms of carbon if an apple were magnified to the size of the earth then the atoms in the apple would be approximately the size of the original apple radioactive decay this diagram shows the half life t½ of various isotopes with protons and neutrons every element has one or more isotopes that have unstable nuclei that are subject to radioactive decay causing the nucleus to emit particles or electromagnetic radiation radioactivity can occur when the radius of nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force which only acts over distances on the order of fm the most common forms of radioactive decay are alpha decay this process is caused when the nucleus emits an alpha particle which is helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons the result of the emission is new element with lower atomic number beta decay and electron capture these processes are regulated by the weak force and result from transformation of neutron into proton or proton into neutron the neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino while proton to neutron transition except in electron capture causes the emission of positron and neutrino the electron or positron emissions are called beta particles beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one electron capture is more common than positron emission because it requires less energy in this type of decay an electron is absorbed by the nucleus rather than positron emitted from the nucleus neutrino is still emitted in this process and proton changes to neutron gamma decay this process results from change in the energy level of the nucleus to lower state resulting in the emission of electromagnetic radiation the excited state of nucleus which results in gamma emission usually occurs following the emission of an alpha or beta particle thus gamma decay usually follows alpha or beta decay other more rare types of radioactive decay include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of nucleons from nucleus or more than one beta particle an analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in different way is internal conversion process that produces high speed electrons that are not beta rays followed by production of high energy photons that are not gamma rays few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons in decay called spontaneous nuclear fission each radioactive isotope has characteristic decay time period the half life that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of sample to decay this is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by every half life hence after two half lives have passed only of the isotope is present and so forth magnetic moment elementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known as spin this is analogous to the angular momentum of an object that is spinning around its center of mass although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point like and cannot be said to be rotating spin is measured in units of the reduced planck constant with electrons protons and neutrons all having spin or spin in an atom electrons in motion around the nucleus possess orbital angular momentum in addition to their spin while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin the magnetic field produced by an atom its magnetic moment is determined by these various forms of angular momentum just as rotating charged object classically produces magnetic field however the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin due to the nature of electrons to obey the pauli exclusion principle in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state bound electrons pair up with each other with one member of each pair in spin up state and the other in the opposite spin down state thus these spins cancel each other out reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons in ferromagnetic elements such as iron cobalt and nickel an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and net overall magnetic moment the orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction when the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up the material can produce measurable macroscopic field paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence of field the nucleus of an atom will have no spin when it has even numbers of both neutrons and protons but for other cases of odd numbers the nucleus may have spin normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of thermal equilibrium however for certain elements such as xenon it is possible to polarize significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction condition called this has important applications in magnetic resonance imaging energy levels these electron energy levels not to scale are sufficient for ground states of atoms up to cadmium inclusively do not forget that even the top of the diagram is lower than an unbound electron state the potential energy of an electron in an atom is negative its dependence of its position reaches the minimum the most absolute value inside the nucleus and vanishes when the distance from the nucleus goes to infinity roughly in an inverse proportion to the distance in the quantum mechanical model bound electron can only occupy set of states centered on the nucleus and each state corresponds to specific energy level see time independent schrödinger equation for theoretical explanation an energy level can be measured by the amount of energy needed to unbind the electron from the atom and is usually given in units of electronvolts ev the lowest energy state of bound electron is called the ground state stationary state while an electron transition to higher level results in an excited state the electron energy raises when increases because the average distance to the nucleus increases dependence of the energy on is caused not by electrostatic potential of the nucleus but by interaction between electrons for an electron to transition between two different states grounded state to first excited level ionization it must absorb or emit photon at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those levels according to niels bohr model what can be precisely calculated by the schrödinger equation electrons jump between orbitals in particle like fashion for example if single photon strikes the electrons only single electron changes states in response to the photon see electron properties the energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its frequency so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the electromagnetic spectrum each element has characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge subshells filled by electrons the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors an example of absorption lines in spectrum when continuous spectrum of energy is passed through gas or plasma some of the photons are absorbed by atoms causing electrons to change their energy level those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as photon traveling in random direction and so drop back to lower energy levels thus the atoms behave like filter that forms series of dark absorption bands in the energy output an observer viewing the atoms from view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background instead sees series of emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of atomic spectral lines allow the composition and physical properties of substance to be determined close examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display fine structure splitting this occurs because of spin orbit coupling which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron when an atom is in an external magnetic field spectral lines become split into three or more components phenomenon called the zeeman effect this is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level which thus appear as single spectral line the interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels resulting in multiple spectral lines the presence of an external electric field can cause comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels phenomenon called the stark effect if bound electron is in an excited state an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of photon with matching energy level for this to occur the electron must drop to lower energy state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon the emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases that is the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized this physical property is used to make lasers which can emit coherent beam of light energy in narrow frequency band valence and bonding behavior valency is the combining power of an element it is equal to number of hydrogen atoms that atom can combine or displace in forming compounds the outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as the valence shell and the electrons in that shell are called valence electrons the number of valence electrons determines the bonding behavior with other atoms atoms tend to chemically react with each other in manner that fills or empties their outer valence shells for example transfer of single electron between atoms is useful approximation for bonds that form between atoms with one electron more than filled shell and others that are one electron short of full shell such as occurs in the compound sodium chloride and other chemical ionic salts however many elements display multiple valences or tendencies to share differing numbers of electrons in different compounds thus chemical bonding between these elements takes many forms of electron sharing that are more than simple electron transfers examples include the element carbon and the organic compounds the chemical elements are often displayed in periodic table that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties and elements with the same number of valence electrons form group that is aligned in the same column of the table the horizontal rows correspond to the filling of quantum shell of electrons the elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons which results in chemically inert elements known as the noble gases states snapshots illustrating the formation of bose einstein condensate quantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions such as temperature and pressure by varying the conditions materials can transition between solids liquids gases and plasmas within state material can also exist in different allotropes an example of this is solid carbon which can exist as graphite or diamond gaseous allotropes exist as well such as dioxygen and ozone at temperatures close to absolute zero atoms can form bose einstein condensate at which point quantum mechanical effects which are normally only observed at the atomic scale become apparent on macroscopic scale this super cooled collection of atoms then behaves as single super atom which may allow fundamental checks of quantum mechanical behavior identification scanning tunneling microscope image showing the individual atoms making up this gold surface the surface atoms deviate from the bulk crystal structure and arrange in columns several atoms wide with pits between them see surface reconstruction the scanning tunneling microscope is device for viewing surfaces at the atomic level it uses the quantum tunneling phenomenon which allows particles to pass through barrier that would normally be insurmountable electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes on each of which is an adsorbed atom providing tunneling current density that can be measured scanning one atom taken as the tip as it moves past the other the sample permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for constant current the calculation shows the extent to which scanning tunneling microscope images of an individual atom are visible it confirms that for low bias the microscope images the space averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels the fermi level local density of states an atom can be ionized by removing one of its electrons the electric charge causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through magnetic field the radius by which the trajectory of moving ion is turned by the magnetic field is determined by the mass of the atom the mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass to charge ratio of ions if sample contains multiple isotopes the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry both of which use plasma to vaporize samples for analysis more area selective method is electron energy loss spectroscopy which measures the energy loss of an electron beam within transmission electron microscope when it interacts with portion of sample the atom probe tomograph has sub nanometer resolution in and can chemically identify individual atoms using time of flight mass spectrometry spectra of excited states can be used to analyze the atomic composition of distant stars specific light wavelengths contained in the observed light from stars can be separated out and related to the quantized transitions in free gas atoms these colors can be replicated using gas discharge lamp containing the same element helium was discovered in this way in the spectrum of the sun years before it was found on earth origin and current state atoms form about of the total energy density of the observable universe with an average density of about atoms within galaxy such as the milky way atoms have much higher concentration with the density of matter in the interstellar medium ism ranging from to atoms the sun is believed to be inside the local bubble region of highly ionized gas so the density in the solar neighborhood is only about atoms stars form from dense clouds in the ism and the evolutionary processes of stars result in the steady enrichment of the ism with elements more massive than hydrogen and helium up to of the milky way atoms are concentrated inside stars and the total mass of atoms forms about of the mass of the galaxy the remainder of the mass is an unknown dark matter formation electrons are thought to exist in the universe since early stages of the big bang atomic nuclei forms in nucleosynthesis reactions in about three minutes big bang nucleosynthesis produced most of the helium lithium and deuterium in the universe and perhaps some of the beryllium and boron ubiquitousness and stability of atoms relies on their binding energy which means that an atom has lower energy than an unbound system of the nucleus and electrons where the temperature is much higher than ionization potential the matter exists in the form of plasma gas of positively charged ions possibly bare nuclei and electrons when the temperature drops below the ionization potential atoms become statistically favorable atoms complete with bound electrons became to dominate over charged particles years after the big bang an epoch called recombination when the expanding universe cooled enough to allow electrons to become attached to nuclei since the big bang which produced no carbon or heavier elements atomic nuclei have been combined in stars through the process of nuclear fusion to produce more of the element helium and via the triple alpha process the sequence of elements from carbon up to iron see stellar nucleosynthesis for details isotopes such as lithium as well as some beryllium and boron are generated in space through cosmic ray spallation this occurs when high energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus causing large numbers of nucleons to be ejected elements heavier than iron were produced in supernovae through the process and in agb stars through the process both of which involve the capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei elements such as lead formed largely through the radioactive decay of heavier elements earth most of the atoms that make up the earth and its inhabitants were present in their current form in the nebula that collapsed out of molecular cloud to form the solar system the rest are the result of radioactive decay and their relative proportion can be used to determine the age of the earth through radiometric dating most of the helium in the crust of the earth about of the helium from gas wells as shown by its lower abundance of helium is product of alpha decay there are few trace atoms on earth that were not present at the beginning not primordial nor are results of radioactive decay carbon is continuously generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere some atoms on earth have been artificially generated either deliberately or as by products of nuclear reactors or explosions of the transuranic elements those with atomic numbers greater than only plutonium and neptunium occur naturally on earth transuranic elements have radioactive lifetimes shorter than the current age of the earth and thus identifiable quantities of these elements have long since decayed with the exception of traces of plutonium possibly deposited by cosmic dust natural deposits of plutonium and neptunium are produced by neutron capture in uranium ore the earth contains approximately atoms although small numbers of independent atoms of noble gases exist such as argon neon and helium of the atmosphere is bound in the form of molecules including carbon dioxide and diatomic oxygen and nitrogen at the surface of the earth an overwhelming majority of atoms combine to form various compounds including water salt silicates and oxides atoms can also combine to create materials that do not consist of discrete molecules including crystals and liquid or solid metals this atomic matter forms networked arrangements that lack the particular type of small scale interrupted order associated with molecular matter rare and theoretical forms superheavy elements while isotopes with atomic numbers higher than lead are known to be radioactive an island of stability has been proposed for some elements with atomic numbers above these superheavy elements may have nucleus that is relatively stable against radioactive decay the most likely candidate for stable superheavy atom unbihexium has protons and neutrons exotic matter each particle of matter has corresponding antimatter particle with the opposite electrical charge thus the positron is positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is negatively charged equivalent of proton when matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet they annihilate each other because of this along with an imbalance between the number of matter and antimatter particles the latter are rare in the universe the first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood although theories of baryogenesis may offer an explanation as result no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature however in the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom antihydrogen was synthesized at the cern laboratory in geneva other exotic atoms have been created by replacing one of the protons neutrons or electrons with other particles that have the same charge for example an electron can be replaced by more massive muon forming muonic atom these types of atoms can be used to test the fundamental predictions of physics see also notes references sources further reading external links the actual physics lesson

aluminium or aluminum is chemical element with symbol al and atomic number it is silvery white soft nonmagnetic ductile metal in the boron group by mass aluminium makes up about of the earth crust it is the third most abundant element after oxygen and silicon and the most abundant metal in the crust though it is less common in the mantle below the chief ore of aluminium is bauxite aluminium metal is so chemically reactive that native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments instead it is found combined in over different minerals aluminium is remarkable for its low density and its ability to resist corrosion through the phenomenon of passivation aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and important in transportation and building industries such as building facades and window frames the oxides and sulfates are the most useful compounds of aluminium despite its prevalence in the environment no known form of life uses aluminium salts metabolically but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals because of these salts abundance the potential for biological role for them is of continuing interest and studies continue physical characteristics nuclei and isotopes aluminium atomic number is of aluminium isotopes only one is stable al it is the only isotope that has existed on earth in its current form since the creation of the planet it is essentially the only isotope representing the element on earth which makes aluminium mononuclidic element and practically equates its standard atomic weight to that of the isotope such low standard atomic weight of aluminium has some effects on the properties of the element see below all other isotopes are radioactive and could not have survived the most stable isotope of these is al half life years al is produced from argon in the atmosphere by spallation caused by cosmic ray protons and used in radiodating the ratio of al to be has been used to study transport deposition sediment storage burial times and erosion on to year time scales most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of al was responsible for the melting and differentiation of some asteroids after their formation billion years ago the remaining isotopes of aluminium with mass numbers ranging from to all have half lives well under an hour three metastable states are known all with half lives under minute electron shell an aluminium atom has electrons arranged in an electron configuration of ne with three atoms beyond stable noble gas configuration accordingly the combined first three ionization energies of aluminium are far lower than the fourth ionization energy alone aluminium can relatively easily surrender its three outermost electrons in many chemical reactions see below the of aluminium is pauling scale free aluminium atom has radius of pm with the three outermost electrons removed the radius shrinks to pm for coordinated atom or pm for coordinated atom at standard temperature and pressure aluminium atoms when not affected by atoms of other elements form face centered cubic crystal system bound by metallic bonding provided by atoms outermost electrons hence aluminium at these conditions is metal this crystal system is shared by some other metals such as lead and copper the size of unit cell of aluminium is comparable to that of those bulk etched surface from high purity aluminium bar size mm aluminium metal when in quantity is very shiny and resembles silver another important characteristic of aluminium is its low density cm aluminium is relatively soft durable lightweight ductile and malleable with appearance ranging from silvery to dull gray depending on the surface roughness it is nonmagnetic and does not easily ignite fresh film of aluminium serves as good reflector approximately of visible light and an excellent reflector as much as of medium and far infrared radiation the yield strength of pure aluminium is mpa while aluminium alloys have yield strengths ranging from mpa to mpa aluminium has about one third the density and stiffness of steel it is easily machined cast drawn and extruded aluminium atoms are arranged in face centered cubic fcc structure aluminium has stacking fault energy of approximately mj aluminium is good thermal and electrical conductor having the conductivity of copper both thermal and electrical while having only of copper density aluminium is capable of with superconducting critical temperature of kelvin and critical magnetic field of about gauss milliteslas aluminium is the most common material for the fabrication of superconducting qubits chemistry corrosion resistance can be excellent because thin surface layer of aluminium oxide forms when the bare metal is exposed to air effectively preventing further oxidation in process termed passivation the strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to galvanic reactions with alloyed copper this corrosion resistance is greatly reduced by aqueous salts particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals in highly acidic solutions aluminium reacts with water to form hydrogen and in highly alkaline ones to form aluminates protective passivation under these conditions is negligible primarily because it is corroded by dissolved chlorides such as common sodium chloride household plumbing is never made from aluminium however because of its general resistance to corrosion aluminium is one of the few metals that retains silvery reflectance in finely powdered form making it an important component of silver colored paints aluminium mirror finish has the highest reflectance of any metal in the nm uv and the nm far ir regions in the nm visible range it is slightly outperformed by tin and silver and in the nm near ir by silver gold and copper aluminium is oxidized by water at temperatures below to produce hydrogen aluminium hydroxide and heat al al oh this conversion is of interest for the production of hydrogen however commercial application of this fact has challenges in circumventing the passivating oxide layer which inhibits the reaction and in storing the energy required to regenerate the aluminium metal inorganic compounds the vast majority of compounds including all al containing minerals and all commercially significant aluminium compounds feature aluminium in the oxidation state the coordination number of such compounds varies but generally al is six coordinate or tetracoordinate almost all compounds of aluminium iii are colorless all four trihalides are well known unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides aluminium fluoride alf features six coordinate al the octahedral coordination environment for alf is related to the compactness of the fluoride ion six of which can fit around the small al center alf sublimes with cracking at with heavier halides the coordination numbers are lower the other trihalides are dimeric or polymeric with tetrahedral al centers these materials are prepared by treating aluminium metal with the halogen although other methods exist acidification of the oxides or hydroxides affords hydrates in aqueous solution the halides often form mixtures generally containing six coordinate al centers that feature both halide and aquo ligands when aluminium and fluoride are together in aqueous solution they readily form complex ions such as and in the case of chloride polyaluminium clusters are formed such as al oh aluminium hydrolysis as function of ph coordinated water molecules are omitted aluminium forms one stable oxide with the chemical formula al it can be found in nature in the mineral corundum aluminium oxide is also commonly called alumina sapphire and ruby are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals the two oxide hydroxides alo oh are boehmite and diaspore there are three trihydroxides bayerite gibbsite and nordstrandite which differ in their crystalline structure polymorphs most are produced from ores by variety of wet processes using acid and base heating the hydroxides leads to formation of corundum these materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful aluminium carbide al is made by heating mixture of the elements above the pale yellow crystals consist of tetrahedral aluminium centers it reacts with water or dilute acids to give methane the acetylide al is made by passing acetylene over heated aluminium aluminium nitride aln is the only nitride known for aluminium unlike the oxides it features tetrahedral al centers it can be made from the elements at it is air stable material with usefully high thermal conductivity aluminium phosphide alp is made similarly it hydrolyses to give phosphine alp al oh ph rarer oxidation states although the great majority of aluminium compounds feature al centers compounds with lower oxidation states are known and sometime of significance as precursors to the al species aluminium alf alcl and albr exist in the gaseous phase when the trihalide is heated with aluminium the composition is unstable at room temperature converting to triiodide ali ali al stable derivative of aluminium monoiodide is the cyclic adduct formed with triethylamine also of theoretical interest but only of fleeting existence are al and al al is made by heating the normal oxide al with silicon at in vacuum such materials quickly to the starting materials aluminium ii very simple al ii compounds are invoked or observed in the reactions of al metal with oxidants for example aluminium monoxide alo has been detected in the gas phase after explosion and in stellar absorption spectra more thoroughly investigated are compounds of the formula al which contain an al al bond and where is large organic ligand organoaluminium compounds and related hydrides structure of compound that features five coordinate carbon variety of compounds of empirical formula alr and alr cl exist these species usually feature tetrahedral al centers formed by dimerization with some or cl bridging between both al atoms has the formula al ch see figure with large organic groups compounds exist as three coordinate monomers such as such compounds are widely used in industrial chemistry despite the fact that they are often highly pyrophoric few analogues exist between organoaluminium and organoboron compounds other than large organic groups the important aluminium hydride is lithium aluminium hydride lialh which is used in as reducing agent in organic chemistry it can be produced from lithium hydride and aluminium trichloride lih alcl lialh licl several useful derivatives of lialh are known sodium bis methoxyethoxy the simplest hydride aluminium hydride or alane remains laboratory curiosity it is polymer with the formula alh in contrast to the corresponding boron hydride that is dimer with the formula bh natural occurrence bauxite major aluminium ore the red brown color is due to the presence of iron minerals stable aluminium is created when hydrogen fuses with magnesium either in large stars or in supernovae it is estimated to be the th most common element in the universe by mass fraction however among the elements that have odd atomic numbers aluminium is the third most abundant by mass fraction after hydrogen and nitrogen in the earth crust aluminium is the most abundant by mass metallic element and the third most abundant of all elements after oxygen and silicon the earth crust has greater abundance of aluminium than the rest of the planet primarily in aluminium silicates in the earth mantle which is only aluminium by mass these aluminium silicate minerals are largely replaced by silica and magnesium oxides overall the earth is about aluminium by mass eighth in abundance by mass aluminium occurs in greater proportion in the earth than in the solar system and universe because the more common elements hydrogen helium neon nitrogen carbon as hydrocarbon are volatile at earth proximity to the sun and large quantities of those were lost because of its strong affinity for oxygen aluminium is almost never found in the elemental state instead it is found in oxides or silicates feldspars the most common group of minerals in the earth crust are native aluminium metal can only be found as minor phase in low oxygen fugacity environments such as the interiors of certain volcanoes native aluminium has been reported in cold seeps in the northeastern continental slope of the south china sea chen et al propose the theory that these deposits resulted from bacterial reduction of al oh aluminium also occurs in the minerals beryl cryolite garnet spinel and turquoise impurities in al such as chromium and iron yield the gemstones ruby and sapphire respectively although aluminium is common and widespread element not all aluminium minerals are economically viable sources of the metal almost all metallic aluminium is produced from the ore bauxite alo oh bauxite occurs as weathering product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic conditions bauxite is mined from large deposits in australia brazil guinea and jamaica it is also mined from lesser deposits in china india indonesia russia and suriname history the statue of anteros in piccadilly circus london was made in and is one of the first statues cast in aluminium early history aluminium metal was unknown to ancient people some sources based on an account by pliny the elder suggest possibility that roman in the time of the emperor tiberius had isolated aluminium however this claim has been disputed it is possible that the chinese were able to produce aluminium containing alloys during the reign of the first jin dynasty the history of aluminium has been shaped by usage of alum first written record of alum made by greek historian herodotus dates back to the th century bce the ancients are known to have used alum as dyeing mordants and for city defense after the crusades alum good indispensable in european fabric industry was subject of international commerce it was imported to europe from the eastern mediterranean until the mid th century establishing nature of alum the nature of alum remained unknown around swiss physician paracelsus identified alum as separate from vitriole sulfates suggesting it was salt of an earth of alum in german doctor and chemist andreas libavius demonstrated that alum and green and blue vitriole were formed by the same acid but different earths for the undiscovered earth that formed alum he proposed the name alumina in german chemist friedrich hoffmann announced his belief that the base of alum was distinct earth in french chemist étienne geoffroy saint hilaire suggested that alum was formed by an unknown earth and the sulfuric acid friedrich wöhler the chemist who first thoroughly described the aluminium metal in german chemist andreas sigismund marggraf synthesized the earth of alum by boiling clay in sulfuric acid and subsequently adding potash in french chemist pierre macquer wrote that alumina resembled metallic earth in french chemist antoine lavoisier wrote he considered highly probable that alumina was an oxide of metal which had an affinity for oxygen so strong no known reducing agents could overcome it in lavoisier replaced the dominant phlogiston theory with the idea of oxygen combustion and stated that metallic earths were oxides of their metals swedish chemist jöns jacob berzelius suggested in the formula alo for alumina the correct formula al was established by the german chemist eilhard mitscherlich in this helped berzelius determine the correct atomic weight of the metal synthesis of metal attempts to produce the aluminium metal date back to the first successful attempt however was completed in by danish physicist and chemist hans christian ørsted he reacted anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium amalgam yielding lump of metal looking similar to tin he presented his results and demonstrated sample of the new metal in ørsted gave little importance to his discovery different source suggests he could not continue his research because of financial reasons because of this and that he published his work in an unknown to the general european public danish magazine he is often not credited as the discoverer of the element german chemist friedrich wöhler visited ørsted in ørsted told wöhler he did not intend to continue his research on aluminium extraction wöhler was engaged with the problem and investigated it on his return from denmark after repeating ørsted experiments wöhler did not identify any aluminium the reason for this inconsistency was only discovered in he conducted similar experiment in by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium and produced powder of aluminium in he was able to produce small pieces of the metal and described some physical properties of this metal the capstone of the washington monument washington united states was made in from aluminium at the time it was the largest piece of aluminium ever cast rare metal as wöhler method could not yield great quantities of aluminium the metal remained rare its cost exceeded that of gold french chemist henri etienne sainte claire deville announced an industrial method of aluminium production in at the paris academy of sciences aluminium trichloride could be reduced by sodium which was more convenient and less expensive than potassium which wöhler had used subsequently bars of aluminium were exhibited for the first time to the general public at the exposition universelle of in deville along with companions established the world first industrial production of aluminium from to the price of aluminium dropped by an order of magnitude from us to per pound even then aluminium was still not of great purity and produced aluminium differed in properties by sample at the next fair in paris in the visitors were presented aluminium wire and foil by the time of the next fair in aluminium had become symbol of the future electrolytic production griesheim germany constructed in the first industrial large scale production method was independently developed by french engineer paul héroult and american engineer charles martin hall it is now known as the hall héroult process héroult long could not find enough interest in his invention as demand for aluminium was still small he started industrial production of aluminium bronze in neuhausen am rheinfall in héroult sold his patents in year the buyers appointed him to the position of director of smelter in isère which would produce on large scale aluminium bronze at the initiation and pure aluminium in few months at the same time hall invented the same process and successfully tested it he then sought to employ it for large scale production for that however the existing smelters refused to adopt the new technique he started the pittsburgh reduction company in where he initiated mass production of aluminium in the coming years this technology was improved and new factories were constructed the hall héroult process converts alumina into the metal austrian chemist carl joseph bayer discovered way of purifying bauxite to yield alumina now known as the bayer process in modern production of the aluminium metal is based on the bayer and hall héroult processes the hall héroult process was further improved in by team led by swedish chemist carl wilhelm söderberg this improvement greatly increased the world output of aluminium mass usage prices of aluminium did drop and aluminium had become widely used in jewelry everyday items eyeglass frames and optical instruments by the early aluminium tableware began to be produced in the late th century and gradually supplanted copper and cast iron tableware in the first decades of the th century aluminium foil was also popularized at that time aluminium is soft and light it was soon discovered however that alloying it with other metals could increase its hardness while preserving the low density aluminium ability to form alloys with other metals provided the metal many uses in the late th and early th centuries for instance aluminium bronze is applied to make flexible bands sheets and wire and is widely employed in the shipbuilding and aviation industries during world war major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light strong airframes they often subsidized factories and the necessary electrical supply systems aviation during that time employed new aluminium alloy duralumin invented in by german materials scientist alfred wilm world production of aluminium since by the mid th century aluminium had become part of everyday lives also becoming an essential component of houseware during the mid th century aluminium emerged as civil engineering material with buildings using for both basic construction and interior and advanced its use in military engineering for both airplanes and land armor vehicle engines in the beginning of the second half of that century the space race began earth first artificial satellite launched in consisted of two separate aluminium semi spheres joined together and all subsequent space vehicles have been made of aluminium the aluminium can was invented in and employed as storage for drinks in throughout the th century the production of aluminium rose rapidly while the world production of aluminium in was metric tons the annual production first exceeded metric tons in tons in tons in in the the increased demand for aluminium made it an exchange commodity it entered the london metal exchange the oldest industrial metal exchange in the world in the output continued to grow the annual production of aluminium exceeded metric tons in the real price for aluminium declined from per metric ton in to in all prices in this subsection are in united states dollars extraction and processing costs were lowered over technological progress and the scale of the economies however the need to exploit lower grade poorer quality deposits and the use of fast increasing input costs above all energy increased the net cost of aluminium the real price began to grow in the with the rise of energy cost production moved from the industrialized countries to countries where production was cheaper after aluminium became an exchange commodity aluminium has been traded for united states dollars and its price fluctuated along with the exchange rates of the currency production costs in the late th century changed because of advances in technology lower energy prices exchange rates of the united states dollar and alumina prices the bric countries combined share grew in the first decade of the st century from to in primary production and to in primary consumption china is accumulating an especially large share of world production thanks to abundance of resources cheap energy and governmental stimuli it also increased its consumption share from in to in in the united states western europe and japan most aluminium was consumed in transportation engineering construction and packaging etymology aluminium is named after alumina or aluminium oxide in modern nomenclature the word alumina comes from alum the mineral from which it was collected the word alum comes from alumen latin word meaning bitter salt the word alumen stems from the proto indo european root alu meaning bitter or beer british chemist humphry davy who performed number of experiments aimed to synthesize the metal is credited as the person who named aluminium in he suggested the metal be named alumium this suggestion was criticized by contemporary chemists from france germany and sweden who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide alumina from which it would be isolated in davy chose aluminum thus producing the modern name however it is spelled and pronounced differently in north america and most other countries aluminum is in use in the and canada while aluminium is in use elsewhere spelling the suffix followed the precedent set in other newly discovered elements of the time potassium sodium magnesium calcium and strontium all of which davy isolated himself nevertheless element names ending in were not unknown at the time for example platinum known to europeans since the th century molybdenum discovered in and tantalum discovered in the suffix is consistent with the universal spelling alumina for the oxide as opposed to aluminia compare to lanthana the oxide of lanthanum and magnesia ceria and thoria the oxides of magnesium cerium and thorium respectively in british scientist thomas young wrote an anonymous review of davy book in which he objected to aluminum and proposed the name aluminium for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word in preference to aluminum which has less classical sound this name did catch on while the spelling was occasionally used in britain the american scientific language used from the start most scientists used throughout the world in the th century it still remains the standard in most other languages in american lexicographer noah webster used exclusively the aluminum spelling in his american dictionary of the english language in the the spelling started to gain usage in the united states by the it had become the more common spelling there outside science in hall used the spelling in his advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal despite his constant use of the spelling in all the patents he filed between and it was subsequently suggested this was typo rather than intended by both spellings had been common in the overall the spelling being slightly more common by the situation had reversed by aluminum had been twice as common as aluminium during the following decade the spelling dominated american usage in the american chemical society adopted this spelling the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac adopted aluminium as the standard international name for the element in in they recognized aluminum as an acceptable variant the same is true for the most recent edition of the iupac nomenclature of inorganic chemistry iupac official publications use the spelling as primary but list both where appropriate english wikipedia follows this standard by adopting the aluminium spelling as the sole spelling in chemistry related articles production and refinement extrusion billets of aluminium bayer process and hall héroult processes bauxite is converted to aluminium oxide al by the bayer process relevant chemical equations are al naoh naalo naalo al oh naoh al oh al the intermediate sodium aluminate with the simplified formula naalo is soluble in strongly alkaline water and the other components of the ore are not depending on the quality of the bauxite ore twice as much waste bauxite tailings as alumina is generated the conversion of alumina to aluminium metal is achieved by the hall héroult process in this energy intensive process solution of alumina in molten mixture of cryolite na alf with calcium fluoride is electrolyzed to produce metallic aluminium al al the liquid aluminium metal sinks to the bottom of the solution and is tapped off and usually cast into large blocks called aluminium billets for further processing carbon dioxide is produced at the carbon anode co the carbon anode is consumed by reaction with oxygen to form carbon dioxide gas with small quantity of fluoride gases in modern smelters the gas is filtered through alumina to remove fluorine compounds and return aluminium fluoride to the electrolytic cells the anode the reduction cell must be replaced regularly since it is consumed in the process the cathode is also eroded mainly by electrochemical processes and liquid metal movement induced by intense electrolytic currents after five to ten years depending on the current used in the electrolysis cell must be rebuilt because of cathode wear aluminium electrolysis with the hall héroult process consumes lot of energy the worldwide average specific energy consumption is approximately kilowatt hours per kilogram of aluminium produced to mj kg some smelters achieve approximately kw kg mj kg compare this to the heat of reaction mj kg and the gibbs free energy of reaction mj kg minimizing line currents for older technologies are typically to kiloamperes state of the art smelters operate at about ka the hall heroult process produces aluminium with purity of above further purification can be done by the hoopes process this process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with sodium barium and aluminium fluoride electrolyte the resulting aluminium has purity of electric power represents about to of the cost of producing aluminium depending on the location of the smelter aluminium production consumes roughly of electricity generated in the us aluminium producers tend to locate smelters in places where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive such as the united arab emirates with its large natural gas supplies and iceland and norway with energy generated from renewable sources the world largest smelters of alumina are located in the people republic of china russia and the provinces of quebec and british columbia in canada aluminium spot price in the people republic of china was the top producer of aluminium with almost one fifth world share followed by russia canada and the us reports the british geological survey over the last years australia has become the world top producer of bauxite ore and major producer and exporter of alumina before being overtaken by china in australia produced million tonnes of bauxite in the australian deposits have some refining problems some being high in silica but have the advantage of being shallow and relatively easy to mine aluminium chloride electrolysis process the high energy consumption of hall héroult process motivated the development of the electrolytic process based on aluminium chloride the pilot plant with tons year output was started in by alcoa the plant offered two advantages energy requirements were less than plants using the hall héroult process and ii the more accessible kaolinite instead of bauxite and cryolite was used for feedstock nonetheless the pilot plant was shut down the reasons for failure were the cost of aluminium chloride general technology maturity problems and leakage of the trace amounts of toxic polychlorinated biphenyl compounds aluminium chloride process can also be used for the co production of titanium depending on titanium contents in kaolinite aluminium carbothermic process the non electrolytic aluminium carbothermic process of aluminium production would theoretically be cheaper and consume less energy however it has been in the experimental phase for decades because the high operating temperature creates difficulties in material technology that have not yet been solved recycling aluminium recycling code aluminium is theoretically recyclable without any loss of its natural qualities according to the international resource panel metal stocks in society report the global per capita stock of aluminium in use in society in cars buildings electronics etc is much of this is in more developed countries per capita rather than less developed countries per capita knowing the per capita stocks and their approximate lifespans is important for planning recycling recovery of the metal through recycling has become an important task of the aluminium industry recycling was low profile activity until the late when the growing use of aluminium beverage cans brought it to public awareness recycling involves melting the scrap process that requires only of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore though significant part up to of the input material is lost as dross ash like oxide an aluminium stack melter produces significantly less dross with values reported below the dross can undergo further process to extract aluminium europe has achieved high rates of aluminium recycling ranging from of beverage cans of construction materials and of transport vehicles recycled aluminium is known as secondary aluminium but maintains the same physical properties as primary aluminium secondary aluminium is produced in wide range of formats and is employed in of alloy injections another important use is extrusion white dross from primary aluminium production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be extracted industrially the process produces aluminium billets together with highly complex waste material this waste is difficult to manage it reacts with water releasing mixture of gases including among others hydrogen acetylene and ammonia which spontaneously ignites on contact with air contact with damp air results in the release of copious quantities of ammonia gas despite these difficulties the waste is used as filler in asphalt and concrete applications general use aluminium is the most widely used non ferrous metal the global production of aluminium in was million tonnes it exceeded that of any other metal except iron million tonnes aluminium is almost always alloyed which markedly improves its mechanical properties especially when tempered for example the common aluminium foils and beverage cans are alloys of to aluminium the main alloying agents are copper zinc magnesium manganese and silicon duralumin with the levels of other metals in few percent by weight household aluminium foil austin sports aluminium can some of the many uses for aluminium metal are in transportation automobiles aircraft trucks railway cars marine vessels bicycles spacecraft etc as sheet tube and castings packaging cans foil frame of etc food and beverage containers because of its resistance to corrosion construction windows doors siding building wire sheathing roofing etc wide range of household items from cooking utensils to baseball bats and watches street lighting poles sailing ship masts walking poles outer shells and

pyrotechnics solid rocket fuels explosives and thermite production of hydrogen gas by reaction with water or sodium hydroxide in alloy with magnesium to make aircraft bodies and other transportation components cooking utensils because of its resistance to corrosion and light weight coins in such countries as france italy poland finland romania israel and the former yugoslavia struck from aluminium or an aluminium copper alloy musical instruments some guitar models sport aluminium diamond plates on the surface of the instruments usually either chrome or black kramer guitars and travis bean are both known for having produced guitars with necks made of aluminium which gives the instrument very distinctive sound aluminium is used to make some guitar resonators and some electric guitar speakers aluminium is usually alloyed it is used as pure metal only when corrosion resistance and or workability is more important than strength or hardness the strength of aluminium alloys is abruptly increased with small additions of scandium zirconium or hafnium thin layer of aluminium can be deposited onto flat surface by physical vapor deposition or very infrequently chemical vapor deposition or other chemical means to form optical coatings and mirrors aluminium compounds because aluminium is abundant and most of its derivatives exhibit low toxicity the compounds of aluminium enjoy wide and sometimes large scale applications alumina aluminium oxide al and the associated oxy hydroxides and trihydroxides are produced or extracted from minerals on large scale the great majority of this material is converted to metallic aluminium in about of the domestic shipments in the united states were used for other applications one major use is to absorb water where it is viewed as contaminant or impurity alumina is used to remove water from hydrocarbons in preparation for subsequent processes that would be poisoned by moisture aluminium oxides are common catalysts for industrial processes the claus process to convert hydrogen sulfide to sulfur in refineries and to alkylate amines many industrial catalysts are supported by alumina meaning that the expensive catalyst material platinum is dispersed over surface of the inert alumina being very hard material mohs hardness alumina is widely used as an abrasive being extraordinarily chemically inert it is useful in highly reactive environments such as high pressure sodium lamps sulfates several sulfates of aluminium have industrial and commercial application aluminium sulfate al so is produced on the annual scale of several billions of kilograms about half of the production is consumed in water treatment the next major application is in the manufacture of paper it is also used as mordant in fire extinguishers in fireproofing as food additive number and in leather tanning aluminium ammonium sulfate which is also called ammonium alum nh al so is used as mordant and in leather tanning as is aluminium potassium sulfate al so the consumption of both alums is declining chlorides aluminium chloride alcl is used in petroleum refining and in the production of synthetic rubber and polymers

hydride is powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry are used as lewis acids and cocatalysts is cocatalyst for ziegler natta olefin polymerization to produce vinyl polymers such as polyethene aqueous aluminium ions such as aqueous aluminium sulfate are used to treat against fish parasites such as gyrodactylus salaris in many vaccines certain aluminium salts serve as an immune adjuvant immune response booster to allow the protein in the vaccine to achieve sufficient potency as an immune stimulant aluminium alloys in structural applications aluminium foam aluminium alloys with wide range of properties are used in engineering structures alloy systems are classified by number system ansi or by names indicating their main alloying constituents din and iso the strength and durability of aluminium alloys vary widely not only as result of the components of the specific alloy but also as result of heat treatments and manufacturing processes lack of knowledge of these aspects has from time to time led to improperly designed structures and gained aluminium bad reputation one important structural limitation of aluminium alloys is their fatigue strength unlike steels aluminium alloys have no well defined fatigue limit meaning that fatigue failure eventually occurs under even very small cyclic loadings engineers must assess applications and design for fixed and finite life of the structure rather than infinite life another important property of aluminium alloys is sensitivity to heat workshop procedures are complicated by the fact that aluminium unlike steel melts without first glowing red manual blow torch operations require additional skill and experience aluminium alloys like all structural alloys are subject to internal stresses after heat operations such as welding and casting the lower melting points of aluminium alloys make them more susceptible to distortions from thermally induced stress relief stress can be relieved and controlled during manufacturing by heat treating the parts in an oven followed by gradual cooling in effect annealing the stresses the low melting point of aluminium alloys has not precluded use in rocketry even in combustion chambers where gases can reach the agena upper stage engine used regeneratively cooled aluminium in some parts of the nozzle including the thermally critical throat region another alloy of

in biology aluminium salts are remarkably nontoxic aluminium sulfate having an ld of mg kg oral mouse which corresponds to grams for an person the extremely low acute toxicity notwithstanding the health effects of aluminium are of interest in view of the widespread occurrence of the element in the environment and in commerce health concerns in very high doses aluminium is associated with altered function of the blood brain barrier small percentage of people are allergic to aluminium and experience contact dermatitis digestive disorders vomiting or other symptoms upon contact or ingestion of products containing aluminium such as antiperspirants and antacids in those without allergies aluminium is not as toxic as heavy metals but there is evidence of some toxicity if it is consumed in amounts greater than mg day per kg of body mass the use of aluminium cookware has not been shown to lead to aluminium toxicity in general however excessive consumption of antacids containing aluminium compounds and excessive use of aluminium containing antiperspirants provide more significant exposure levels consumption of acidic foods or liquids with aluminium enhances aluminium absorption and maltol has been shown to increase the accumulation of aluminium in nerve and bone tissues aluminium increases estrogen related gene expression in human breast cancer cells cultured in the laboratory the estrogen like effects of these salts have led to their classification as there is little evidence that aluminium in antiperspirants causes skin irritation nonetheless its occurrence in antiperspirants dyes such as aluminium lake and food additives has caused concern although there is little evidence that normal exposure to aluminium presents risk to healthy adults some studies point to risks associated with increased exposure to the metal aluminium in food may be absorbed more than aluminium from water it is classified as non carcinogen by the us department of health and human services in case of suspected sudden intake of large amount of aluminium deferoxamine mesylate may be given to help eliminate it from the body by chelation occupational safety exposure to powdered aluminium or aluminium welding fumes can cause pulmonary fibrosis the united states occupational safety and health administration osha has set permissible exposure limit of mg time weighted average twa for total exposure and mg twa for respiratory exposure the us national institute for occupational safety and health niosh recommended exposure limit is the same for respiratory exposure but is mg for total exposure and mg for fumes and powder fine aluminium powder can ignite or explode posing another workplace hazard alzheimer disease aluminium has controversially been implicated as factor in alzheimer disease according to the alzheimer society the medical and scientific opinion is that studies have not convincingly demonstrated causal relationship between aluminium and alzheimer disease research in this area has been inconclusive aluminium accumulation may be consequence of the disease rather than causal agent effect on plants aluminium is primary among the factors that reduce plant growth on acid soils although it is generally harmless to plant growth in ph neutral soils the concentration in acid soils of toxic al cations increases and disturbs root growth and function most acid soils are saturated with aluminium rather than hydrogen ions the acidity of the soil is therefore result of hydrolysis of aluminium compounds the concept of corrected lime potential is now used to define the degree of base saturation in soil testing to determine the lime requirement wheat has developed tolerance to aluminium releasing organic compounds that bind to harmful aluminium cations sorghum is believed to have the same tolerance mechanism the first gene for aluminium tolerance has been identified in wheat it was shown that sorghum aluminium tolerance is controlled by single gene as for wheat this adaptation is not found in all plants biodegradation spanish scientific report from claimed that the fungus geotrichum candidum consumes the aluminium in compact discs other reports all refer back to the spanish report and there is no supporting original research better documented the bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fungus cladosporium resinae are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene based fuels not av gas and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium however these life forms do not

the mergui archipelago in burma myanmar an archipelago sometimes called an island group or island chain is chain cluster or collection of islands or sometimes sea containing small number of scattered islands the word archipelago is derived from the greek ἄρχι arkhi chief and πέλαγος pélagos sea through the italian arcipelago in italian possibly following tradition of antiquity the archipelago from medieval greek ἀρχιπέλαγος and latin archipelagus was the proper name for the aegean sea and later usage shifted to refer to the aegean islands since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands types archipelagos may be found isolated in large amounts of water or neighbouring large land mass for example scotland has more than islands surrounding its mainland which form an archipelago archipelagos are often volcanic forming along island arcs generated by subduction zones or hotspots but may also be the result of erosion deposition and land elevation depending on their geological origin islands forming archipelagos can be referred to as oceanic islands continental fragments and continental islands oceanic islands are mainly of volcanic origin continental fragments correspond to land masses that have separated from continental mass due to tectonic displacement finally sets of islands formed close to the coast of continent are considered continental archipelagos when they form part of the same continental shelf so islands are just exposed continental shelf indonesia japan taiwan the philippines new zealand maldives the bahamas greece hawaii the polynesian islands the canary islands and the azores are all examples of well known archipelagos the largest archipelagic state in the world by area and population is indonesia see also island arc list of landforms list of archipelagos by number of islands list of archipelagos list of islands references external links most incredible island archipelagos

ataxia is neurological sign consisting of lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements that includes gait abnormality ataxia is non specific clinical manifestation implying dysfunction of the parts of the nervous system that coordinate movement such as the cerebellum ataxia can be limited to one side of the body which is referred to as hemiataxia several possible causes exist for these patterns of neurological dysfunction dystaxia is mild degree of ataxia friedreich ataxia has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom the word is from greek negative prefix τάξις order lack of order types cerebellar the term cerebellar ataxia is used to indicate ataxia that is due to dysfunction of the cerebellum the cerebellum is responsible for integrating significant amount of neural information that is used to coordinate smoothly ongoing movements and to participate in motor planning although ataxia is not present with all cerebellar lesions many conditions affecting the cerebellum do produce ataxia people with cerebellar ataxia may have trouble regulating the force range direction velocity and rhythm of muscle contractions this results in characteristic type of irregular uncoordinated movement that can manifest itself in many possible ways such as asthenia asynergy delayed reaction time and dyschronometria individuals with cerebellar ataxia could also display instability of gait difficulty with eye movements dysarthria dysphagia hypotonia dysmetria and these deficits can vary depending on which cerebellar structures have been damaged and whether the lesion is bilateral or unilateral people with cerebellar ataxia may initially present with poor balance which could be demonstrated as an inability to stand on one leg or perform tandem gait as the condition progresses walking is characterized by widened base and high stepping as well as staggering and lurching from side to side turning is also problematic and could result in falls as cerebellar ataxia becomes severe great assistance and effort are needed to stand and walk dysarthria an impairment with articulation may also be present and is characterized by scanning speech that consists of slower rate irregular rhythm and variable volume there may also be slurring of speech tremor of the voice and ataxic respiration cerebellar ataxia could result with incoordination of movement particularly in the extremities there is overshooting or hypermetria with finger to nose testing and heel to shin testing thus dysmetria is evident impairments with alternating movements as well as dysrhythmia may also be displayed there may also be tremor of the head and trunk titubation in individuals with cerebellar ataxia it is thought that dysmetria is caused by deficit in the control of interaction torques in multijoint motion interaction torques are created at an associated joint when the primary joint is moved for example if movement required reaching to touch target in front of the body flexion at the shoulder would create torque at the elbow while extension of the elbow would create torque at the wrist these torques increase as the speed of movement increases and must be compensated and adjusted for to create coordinated movement this may therefore explain decreased coordination at higher movement velocities and accelerations dysfunction of the flocculonodular lobe impairs the balance and the control of eye movements this presents itself with postural instability in which the person tends to separate his her feet upon standing to gain wider base and to avoid titubation bodily oscillations tending to be forward backward ones the instability is therefore worsened when standing with the feet together regardless of whether the eyes are open or closed this is negative romberg test or more accurately it denotes the individual inability to carry out the test because the individual feels unstable even with open eyes dysfunction of the spinocerebellum vermis and associated areas near the midline presents itself with wide based drunken sailor gait called truncal ataxia characterised by uncertain starts and stops lateral deviations and unequal steps as result of this gait impairment falling is concern in patients with ataxia studies examining falls in this population show that of patients have fallen at least once in the past year and up to admit to fear of falling dysfunction of the lateral hemispheres presents as disturbances in carrying out voluntary planned movements by the extremities called appendicular ataxia these include intention tremor coarse trembling accentuated over the execution of voluntary movements possibly involving the head and eyes as well as the limbs and torso peculiar writing abnormalities large unequal letters irregular underlining peculiar pattern of dysarthria slurred speech sometimes characterised by explosive variations in voice intensity despite regular rhythm inability to perform rapidly alternating movements known as this could involve rapidly switching from pronation to supination of the forearm movements become more irregular with increases of speed inability to judge distances or ranges of movement this is known as dysmetria and is often seen as undershooting hypometria or overshooting hypermetria the required distance or range to reach target this is sometimes seen when patient is asked to reach out and touch someone finger or touch his or her own nose the rebound phenomenon also known as the loss of the check reflex is also sometimes seen in patients with cerebellar ataxia for example when patient is flexing his or her elbow isometrically against resistance when the resistance is suddenly removed without warning the patient arm may swing up and even strike themselves with an intact check reflex the patient will check and activate the opposing triceps to slow and stop the movement patients may exhibit constellation of subtle to overt cognitive symptoms these symptoms are gathered under the terminology of schmahmann syndrome sensory the term sensory ataxia is employed to indicate ataxia due to loss of proprioception the loss of sensitivity to the positions of joint and body parts this is generally caused by dysfunction of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord because they carry proprioceptive information up to the brain in some cases the cause of sensory ataxia may instead be dysfunction of the various parts of the brain which receive positional information including the cerebellum thalamus and parietal lobes sensory ataxia presents itself with an unsteady stomping gait with heavy heel strikes as well as postural instability that is usually worsened when the lack of proprioceptive input cannot be compensated for by visual input such as in poorly lit environments physicians can find evidence of sensory ataxia during physical examination by having the patient stand with his her feet together and eyes shut in affected patients this will cause the instability to worsen markedly producing wide oscillations and possibly fall this is called positive romberg test worsening of the finger pointing test with the eyes closed is another feature of sensory ataxia also when the patient is standing with arms and hands extended toward the physician if the eyes are closed the patient finger will tend to fall down and then be restored to the horizontal extended position by sudden muscular contractions the ataxic hand vestibular the term vestibular ataxia is employed to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the vestibular system which in acute and unilateral cases is associated with prominent vertigo nausea and vomiting in slow onset chronic bilateral cases of vestibular dysfunction these characteristic manifestations may be absent and dysequilibrium may be the sole presentation causes the three types of ataxia have overlapping causes and therefore can either coexist or occur in isolation focal lesions any type of focal lesion of the central nervous system such as stroke brain tumor multiple sclerosis will cause the type of ataxia corresponding to the site of the lesion cerebellar if in the cerebellum sensory if in the dorsal spinal cord and rarely in the thalamus or parietal lobe vestibular if in the vestibular system including the vestibular areas of the cerebral cortex exogenous substances metabolic ataxia exogenous substances that cause ataxia mainly do so because they have depressant effect on central nervous system function the most common example is ethanol alcohol which is capable of causing reversible cerebellar and vestibular ataxia other examples include various prescription drugs most antiepileptic drugs have cerebellar ataxia as possible adverse effect lithium level over meq synthetic cannabinoid hu ingestion and various other recreational drugs ketamine pcp or all of which are nmda receptor antagonists that produce dissociative state at high doses further class of pharmaceuticals which can cause short term ataxia especially in high doses are the benzodiazepines exposure to high levels of methylmercury through consumption of fish with high mercury concentrations is also known cause of ataxia and other neurological disorders radiation poisoning ataxia can be induced as result of severe acute radiation poisoning with an absorbed dose of more than grays vitamin deficiency vitamin deficiency may cause among several neurological abnormalities overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia hypothyroidism symptoms of neurological dysfunction may be the presenting feature in some patients with hypothyroidism these include reversible cerebellar ataxia dementia peripheral neuropathy psychosis and coma most of the neurological complications improve completely after thyroid hormone replacement therapy causes of isolated sensory ataxia peripheral neuropathies may cause generalised or localised sensory ataxia limb only depending on the extent of the neuropathic involvement spinal disorders of various types may cause sensory ataxia from the lesioned level below when they involve the dorsal columns non hereditary cerebellar degeneration non hereditary causes of cerebellar degeneration include chronic ethanol abuse head injury paraneoplastic and non paraneoplastic autoimmune ataxia high altitude cerebral oedema coeliac disease normal pressure hydrocephalus and infectious or post infectious cerebellitis hereditary ataxias ataxia may depend on hereditary disorders consisting of degeneration of the cerebellum and or of the spine most cases feature both to some extent and therefore present with overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia even though one is often more evident than the other hereditary disorders causing ataxia include autosomal dominant ones such as spinocerebellar ataxia episodic ataxia and atrophy as well as autosomal recessive disorders such as friedreich ataxia sensory and cerebellar with the former predominating and niemann pick disease ataxia telangiectasia sensory and cerebellar with the latter predominating and an example of linked ataxic condition is the rare fragile associated tremor ataxia syndrome arnold chiari malformation congenital ataxia arnold chiari malformation is malformation of the brain it consists of downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils and the medulla through the foramen magnum sometimes causing hydrocephalus as result of obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid outflow succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is an autosomal recessive gene disorder where mutations in the aldh gene results in the accumulation of gamma hydroxybutyric acid ghb in the body ghb accumulates in the nervous system and can cause ataxia as well as other neurological dysfunction wilson disease wilson disease is an autosomal recessive gene disorder whereby an alteration of the atp gene results in an inability to properly excrete copper from the body copper accumulates in the nervous system and liver and can cause ataxia as well as other neurological and organ impairments gluten ataxia male with gluten ataxia previous situation and evolution after months of gluten free diet gluten ataxia is gluten related disorder wide spectrum of disorders marked by an abnormal immunological response to gluten like celiac disease it is an autoimmune disease with gluten ataxia damage takes place in the cerebellum the balance center of the brain that controls coordination and complex movements like walking speaking and swallowing gluten ataxia is the single most common cause of sporadic idiopathic ataxia it accounts for of ataxias of unknown origin and of all ataxias gluten ataxia is an immune mediated disease triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all patients with idiopathic sporadic ataxia the effectiveness of the treatment depends on the elapsed time from the onset of the ataxia until diagnosis the death of neurons in the cerebellum as result of gluten exposure is irreversible early diagnosis and treatment with gluten free diet can improve ataxia and prevent its progression less than of people with gluten ataxia present any symptom yet about have intestinal damage readily available and sensitive markers of gluten ataxia include anti gliadin antibodies immunoglobulin iga deposits against tg in the small bowel and at extraintestinal sites are proving to be additionally reliable and perhaps more specific markers of the whole spectrum of gluten sensitivity they may also hold the key to its pathogenesis gluten ataxia is defined as sporadic cerebellar ataxia associated with the presence circulating antigliadin antibodies and in the absence of an alternative cause for ataxia sodium potassium pump malfunction of the sodium potassium pump may be factor in some ataxias the pump has been shown to control and set the intrinsic activity mode of cerebellar purkinje neurons this suggests that the pump might not simply be homeostatic housekeeping molecule for ionic gradients but could be computational element in the cerebellum and the brain indeed an ouabain block of pumps in the cerebellum of live mouse results in it displaying ataxia and dystonia ataxia is observed for lower ouabain concentrations dystonia is observed at higher ouabain concentrations cerebellar ataxia associated with anti gad antibodies antibodies against the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase gad enzyme changing glutamate in gaba cause cerebellar deficits the antibodies impair motor learning and cause behavioral deficits diagnosis treatment the treatment of ataxia and its effectiveness depend on the underlying cause treatment may limit or reduce the effects of ataxia but it is unlikely to eliminate them entirely recovery tends to be better in individuals with single focal injury such as stroke or benign tumour compared to those who have neurological degenerative condition review of the management of degenerative ataxia was published in small number of rare conditions presenting with prominent cerebellar ataxia are amenable to specific treatment and recognition of these disorders is critical diseases include vitamin deficiency xanthomatosis niemann pick type disease refsum disease glucose transporter type deficiency episodic ataxia type gluten ataxia glutamic acid decarboxylase ataxia the movement disorders associated with ataxia can be managed by pharmacological treatments and through physical therapy and occupational therapy to reduce disability some drug treatments that have been used to control ataxia include htp idebenone amantadine physostigmine carnitine or derivatives trimethoprim vigabatrin acetazolamide aminopyridine buspirone and combination of coenzyme and vitamin physical therapy requires focus on adapting activity and facilitating motor learning for retraining specific functional motor patterns recent systematic review suggested that physical therapy is effective but there is only moderate evidence to support this conclusion the most commonly used physical therapy interventions for cerebellar ataxia are vestibular habituation frenkel exercises proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation pnf and balance training however therapy is often highly individualized and gait and coordination training are large components of therapy current research suggests that if person is able to walk with or without mobility aid physical therapy should include an exercise program addressing five components static balance dynamic balance trunk limb coordination stairs and contracture prevention once the physical therapist determines that the individual is able to safely perform parts of the program independently it is important that the individual be prescribed and regularly engage in supplementary home exercise program that incorporates these components to further improve long term outcomes these outcomes include balance tasks gait and individual activities of daily living while the improvements are attributed primarily to changes in the brain and not just the hip and or ankle joints it is still unknown whether the improvements are due to adaptations in the cerebellum or compensation by other areas of the brain decomposition simplification or slowing of multijoint movement may also be an effective strategy that therapists may use to improve function in patients with ataxia training likely needs to be intense and focused as indicated by one study performed with stroke patients experiencing limb ataxia who underwent intensive upper limb retraining their therapy consisted of constraint induced movement therapy which resulted in improvements of their arm function treatment should likely include strategies to manage difficulties with everyday activities such as walking gait aids such as cane or walker can be provided to decrease the risk of falls associated with impairment of balance or poor coordination severe ataxia may eventually lead to the need for wheelchair to obtain better results possible coexisting motor deficits need to be addressed in addition to those induced by ataxia for example muscle weakness and decreased endurance could lead to increasing fatigue and poorer movement patterns there are several assessment tools available to therapists and health care professionals working with patients with ataxia the international cooperative ataxia rating scale icars is one of the most widely used and has been proven to have very high reliability and validity other tools that assess motor function balance and coordination are also highly valuable to help the therapist track the progress of their patient as well as to quantify the patient functionality these tests include but are not limited to the berg balance scale tandem walking to test for tandem gaitability scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia tapping tests the person must quickly and repeatedly tap their arm or leg while the therapist monitors the amount of finger nose testing this test has several variations including finger to therapist finger finger to finger and alternate nose to finger other uses the term ataxia is sometimes used in broader sense to indicate lack of coordination in some physiological process examples include optic ataxia lack of coordination between visual inputs and hand movements resulting in inability to reach and grab objects and ataxic respiration lack of coordination in respiratory movements usually due to dysfunction of the respiratory centres in the medulla oblongata optic ataxia may be caused by lesions to the posterior parietal cortex which is responsible for combining and expressing positional information and relating it to movement outputs of the posterior parietal cortex include the spinal cord brain stem motor pathways pre motor and pre frontal cortex basal ganglia and the cerebellum some neurons in the posterior parietal cortex are modulated by intention optic ataxia is usually part of balint syndrome but can be seen in isolation with injuries to the superior parietal lobule as it represents disconnection between visual association cortex and the frontal premotor and motor cortex see also ataxic cerebral palsy spinocerebellar

depiction of harvesting in the august calendar page of the queen mary psalter fol ca august is the eighth month of the year in the julian and gregorian calendars falling between july and september and the fifth month to have the length of days it was originally named sextilis in latin because it was the sixth month in the original ten month roman calendar under romulus in bc and march was the first month of the year about bc it became the eighth month when january and february were added to the year before march by king numa pompilius who also gave it days julius caesar added two days when he created the julian calendar in bc giving it its modern length of days in bc it was renamed in honor of augustus according to senatus consultum quoted by macrobius he chose this month because it was the time of several of his great triumphs including the conquest of egypt in the southern hemisphere august is the seasonal equivalent of february in the northern hemisphere in many european countries august is the holiday month for most workers numerous religious holidays occurred during august in ancient rome certain meteor showers take place in august the kappa cygnids take place in august with the dates varying each year the alpha capricornids meteor shower takes place as early as july and ends at around august and the southern delta aquariids take place from mid july to mid august with the peak usually around july the perseids major meteor shower typically takes place between july and august with the days of the peak varying yearly the star cluster of messier is best observed around august among the aborigines of the canary islands especially among the guanches of tenerife the month of august received in the name of beñesmer or beñesmen which was also the harvest festival held this month august symbols gladiolus august birthstones are the peridot sardonyx and spinel its birth flower is the gladiolus or poppy meaning beauty strength of character love marriage and family the

avicenna also ibn sīnā or abu ali sina june was persian polymath who is regarded as one of the most significant physicians astronomers thinkers and writers of the islamic golden age he has been described as the father of early modern medicine of the works he is known to have written around have survived including on philosophy and on medicine his most famous works are the book of healing philosophical and scientific encyclopedia and the canon of medicine medical encyclopedia which became standard medical text at many medieval universities and remained in use as late as in avicenna canon of medicine was reprinted in new york besides philosophy and medicine avicenna corpus includes writings on astronomy alchemy geography and geology psychology islamic theology logic mathematics physics and poetry name is latin corruption of the arabic patronym ibn sīnā meaning son of sina rare persian masculine given name of uncertain etymology however avicenna was not the son but the great great grandson of man named sina his full name was abū ʿalī al ḥusayn ibn ʿabd allāh ibn al ḥasan ibn ʿalī ibn sīnā circumstances ibn sina created an extensive corpus of works during what is commonly known as the islamic golden age in which the translations of greco roman persian and indian texts were studied extensively greco roman mid and neo platonic and aristotelian texts translated by the kindi school were commented redacted and developed substantially by islamic intellectuals who also built upon persian and indian mathematical systems astronomy algebra trigonometry and medicine the samanid dynasty in the eastern part of persia greater khorasan and central asia as well as the buyid dynasty in the western part of persia and iraq provided thriving atmosphere for scholarly and cultural development under the samanids bukhara rivaled baghdad as cultural capital of the islamic world the study of the quran and the hadith thrived in such scholarly atmosphere philosophy fiqh and theology kalaam were further developed most noticeably by avicenna and his opponents al razi and al farabi had provided methodology and knowledge in medicine and philosophy avicenna had access to the great libraries of balkh khwarezm gorgan rey isfahan and hamadan various texts such as the ahd with bahmanyar show that he debated philosophical points with the greatest scholars of the time aruzi samarqandi describes how before avicenna left khwarezm he had met al biruni famous scientist and astronomer abu nasr iraqi renowned mathematician abu sahl masihi respected philosopher and abu al khayr khammar great physician biography early life avicenna was born in afshana village near bukhara in present day uzbekistan the capital of the samanids persian dynasty in central asia and greater khorasan his mother named sitāra was from bukhara his father abdullāh was respected ismaili scholar from balkh an important town of the samanid empire in what is today balkh province afghanistan his father worked in the government of samanid in the village kharmasain sunni regional power after five years his younger brother mahmoud was born avicenna first began to learn the quran and literature in such way that when he was ten years old he had essentially learned all of them according to his autobiography avicenna had memorised the entire quran by the age of he learned indian arithmetic from an indian greengrocer ءmahmoud massahi and he began to learn more from wandering scholar who gained livelihood by curing the sick and teaching the young he also studied fiqh islamic jurisprudence under the sunni hanafi scholar ismail al zahid avicenna was taught some extent of philosophy books such as introduction isagoge porphyry philosopher euclid elements ptolemy almagest by an unpopular philosopher abu abdullah nateli who claimed philosophizing as teenager he was greatly troubled by the metaphysics of aristotle which he could not understand until he read al farabi commentary on the work for the next year and half he studied philosophy in which he encountered greater obstacles in such moments of baffled inquiry he would leave his books perform the requisite ablutions then go to the mosque and continue in prayer till light broke on his difficulties deep into the night he would continue his studies and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution forty times it is said he read through the metaphysics of aristotle till the words were imprinted on his memory but their meaning was hopelessly obscure until one day they found illumination from the little commentary by farabi which he bought at bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams so great was his joy at the discovery made with the help of work from which he had expected only mystery that he hastened to return thanks to god and bestowed alms upon the poor he turned to medicine at and not only learned medical theory but also by gratuitous attendance of the sick had according to his own account discovered new methods of treatment the teenager achieved full status as qualified physician at age and found that medicine is no hard and thorny science like mathematics and metaphysics so soon made great progress became an excellent doctor and began to treat patients using approved remedies the youthful physician fame spread quickly and he treated many patients without asking for payment number of theories have been proposed regarding avicenna madhab school of thought within islamic jurisprudence medieval historian ẓahīr al dīn al bayhaqī considered avicenna to be follower of the brethren of purity on the other hand dimitri gutas along with aisha khan and jules janssens demonstrated that avicenna was sunni hanafi however the th century shia faqih nurullah shushtari according to seyyed hossein nasr maintained that he was most likely twelver shia conversely sharaf khorasani citing rejection of an invitation of the sunni governor sultan mahmoud ghazanavi by avicenna to his court believes that avicenna was an ismaili similar disagreements exist on the background of avicenna family whereas some writers considered them sunni some more recent writers contested that they were shia adulthood drawing of avicenna from ibn sina first appointment was that of physician to the emir nuh ii who owed him his recovery from dangerous illness ibn sina chief reward for this service was access to the royal library of the samanids well known patrons of scholarship and scholars when the library was destroyed by fire not long after the enemies of ibn sina accused him of burning it in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge meanwhile he assisted his father in his financial labors but still found time to write some of his earliest works when ibn sina was years old he lost his father the samanid dynasty came to its end in december ibn sina seems to have declined the offers of mahmud of ghazni and proceeded westwards to urgench in modern turkmenistan where the vizier regarded as friend of scholars gave him small monthly stipend the pay was small however so ibn sina wandered from place to place through the districts of nishapur and merv to the borders of khorasan seeking an opening for his talents qabus the generous ruler of tabaristan himself poet and scholar with whom ibn sina had expected to find asylum was on about that date starved to death by his troops who had revolted ibn sina himself was at this time stricken by severe illness finally at gorgan near the caspian sea ibn sina met with friend who bought dwelling near his own house in which ibn sina lectured on logic and astronomy several of ibn sina treatises were written for this patron and the commencement of his canon of medicine also dates from his stay in hyrcania ibn sina subsequently settled at rey in the vicinity of modern tehran the home town of rhazes where majd addaula son of the last buwayhid emir was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother seyyedeh khatun about thirty of ibn sina shorter works are said to have been composed in rey constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son shams al daula however compelled the scholar to quit the place after brief sojourn at qazvin he passed southwards to hamadãn where shams al daula another buwayhid emir had established himself at first ibn sina entered into the service of high born lady but the emir hearing of his arrival called him in as medical attendant and sent him back with presents to his dwelling ibn sina was even raised to the office of vizier the emir decreed that he should be banished from the country ibn sina however remained hidden for forty days in sheikh ahmed fadhel house until fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post even during this perturbed time ibn sina persevered with his studies and teaching every evening extracts from his great works the canon and the sanatio were dictated and explained to his pupils on the death of the emir ibn sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an apothecary where with intense assiduity he continued the composition of his works meanwhile he had written to abu ya far the prefect of the dynamic city of isfahan offering his services the new emir of hamadan hearing of this correspondence and discovering where ibn sina was hiding incarcerated him in fortress war meanwhile continued between the rulers of isfahan and hamadãn in the former captured hamadan and its towns expelling the tajik mercenaries when the storm had passed ibn sina returned with the emir to hamadan and carried on his literary labors later however accompanied by his brother favorite pupil and two slaves ibn sina escaped from the city in the dress of sufi ascetic after perilous journey they reached isfahan receiving an honorable welcome from the prince later life and death the first page of manuscript of avicenna canon dated yale medical historical library cushing arabic ms gravestone of avicenna hamedan iran the remaining ten or twelve years of ibn sīnā life were spent in the service of the kakuyid ruler muhammad ibn rustam dushmanziyar also known as ala al dawla whom he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific adviser even in his numerous campaigns during these years he began to study literary matters and philology instigated it is asserted by criticisms on his style severe colic which seized him on the march of the army against hamadan was checked by remedies so violent that ibn sina could scarcely stand on similar occasion the disease returned with difficulty he reached hamadan where finding the disease gaining ground he refused to keep up the regimen imposed and resigned himself to his fate his friends advised him to slow down and take life moderately he refused however stating that prefer short life with width to narrow one with length on his deathbed remorse seized him he bestowed his goods on the poor restored unjust gains freed his slaves and read through the quran every three days until his death he died in june in his fifty eighth year in the month of ramadan and was buried in hamadan iran philosophy ibn sīnā wrote extensively on early islamic philosophy especially the subjects logic ethics and metaphysics including treatises named logic and metaphysics most of his works were written in arabic then the language of science in the middle east and some in persian of linguistic significance even to this day are few books that he wrote in nearly pure persian language particularly the danishnamah yi ala philosophy for ala ad dawla ibn sīnā commentaries on aristotle often criticized the philosopher encouraging lively debate in the spirit of ijtihad avicenna neoplatonic scheme of emanations became fundamental in the kalam school of theological discourse in the th century his book of healing became available in europe in partial latin translation some fifty years after its composition under the title sufficientia and some authors have identified latin avicennism as flourishing for some time paralleling the more influential latin averroism but suppressed by the parisian decrees of and avicenna psychology and theory of knowledge influenced william of auvergne bishop of paris and albertus magnus while his metaphysics influenced the thought of thomas aquinas metaphysical doctrine early islamic philosophy and islamic metaphysics imbued as it is with islamic theology distinguishes more clearly than aristotelianism between essence and existence whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental essence endures within being beyond the accidental the philosophy of ibn sīnā particularly that part relating to metaphysics owes much to al farabi the search for definitive islamic philosophy separate from occasionalism can be seen in what is left of his work following al farabi lead avicenna initiated full fledged inquiry into the question of being in which he distinguished between essence mahiat and existence wujud he argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things existence must therefore be due to an agent cause that necessitates imparts gives or adds existence to an essence to do so the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect avicenna consideration of the essence attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being namely impossibility contingency and necessity avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist while the contingent in itself mumkin bi dhatihi has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing contradiction when actualized the contingent becomes necessary existent due to what is other than itself wajib al wujud bi ghayrihi thus contingency in itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself the metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different necessary being due to itself wajib al wujud bi dhatihi is true in itself while the contingent being is false in itself and true due to something else other than itself the necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence it is what always exists the necessary exists due to its self and has no quiddity essence mahiyya other than existence wujud furthermore it is one wahid ahad since there cannot be more than one necessary existent due to itself without differentia fasl to distinguish them from each other yet to require differentia entails that they exist due to themselves as well as due to what is other than themselves and this is contradictory however if no differentia distinguishes them from each other then there is no sense in which these existents are not one and the same avicenna adds that the necessary existent due to itself has no genus jins nor definition hadd nor counterpart nadd nor an opposite did and is detached bari from matter madda quality kayf quantity kam place ayn situation wad and time waqt avicenna theology on metaphysical issues ilāhiyyāt has been criticized by some islamic scholars among them al ghazali ibn taymiyya and ibn al qayyim while discussing the views of the theists among the greek philosophers namely socrates plato and aristotle in al munqidh min ad dalal deliverance from error al ghazali noted that the greek philosophers must be taxed with unbelief as must their partisans among the muslim philosophers such as ibn sina and al farabi and their likes he added that none however of the muslim philosophers engaged so much in transmitting aristotle lore as did the two men just mentioned the sum of what we regard as the authentic philosophy of aristotle as transmitted by al farabi and ibn sina can be reduced to three parts part which must be branded as unbelief part which must be stigmatized as innovation and part which need not be repudiated at all argument for god existence avicenna made an argument for the existence of god which would be known as the proof of the truthful arabic al burhan al siddiqin avicenna argued that there must be necessary existent arabic wajib al wujud an entity that cannot not exist and through series of argument he identified it with god of islam present day historian of philosophy peter adamson called this argument one of the most influential medieval arguments for god existence and avicenna biggest contribution to the history of philosophy al biruni correspondence correspondence between ibn sina with his student ahmad ibn ali al ma sumi and al biruni has survived in which they debated aristotelian natural philosophy and the peripatetic school abu rayhan began by asking avicenna eighteen questions ten of which were criticisms of aristotle on the heavens theology avicenna was devout muslim and sought to reconcile rational philosophy with islamic theology his aim was to prove the existence of god and his creation of the world scientifically and through reason and logic avicenna views on islamic theology and philosophy were enormously influential forming part of the core of the curriculum at islamic religious schools until the th century avicenna wrote number of short treatises dealing with islamic theology these included treatises on the prophets whom he viewed as inspired philosophers and also on various scientific and philosophical interpretations of the quran such as how quranic cosmology corresponds to his own philosophical system in general these treatises linked his philosophical writings to islamic religious ideas for example the body afterlife there are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works however that avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion he did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such theory if prophecy could be questioned and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly without digressing to consider epistemological matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers later interpretations of avicenna philosophy split into three different schools those such as al tusi who continued to apply his philosophy as system to interpret later political events and scientific advances those such as al razi who considered avicenna theological works in isolation from his wider philosophical concerns and those such as al ghazali who selectively used parts of his philosophy to support their own attempts to gain greater spiritual insights through variety of mystical means it was the theological interpretation championed by those such as al razi which eventually came to predominate in the madrasahs avicenna memorized the quran by the age of ten and as an adult he wrote five treatises commenting on suras from the quran one of these texts included the proof of prophecies in which he comments on several quranic verses and holds the quran in high esteem avicenna argued that the islamic prophets should be considered higher than philosophers thought experiments while he was imprisoned in the castle of fardajan near hamadhan avicenna wrote his famous floating man literally falling man thought experiment to demonstrate human self awareness and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul avicenna believed his floating man thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is substance and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness even in situation that prevents all sensory data input the thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air isolated from all sensations which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies he argued that in this scenario one would still have self consciousness because it is conceivable that person suspended in air while cut off from sense experience would still be capable of determining his own existence the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is perfection independent of the body and an immaterial substance the conceivability of this floating man indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually which entails the soul separateness from the body avicenna referred to the living human intelligence particularly the active intellect which he believed to be the hypostasis by which god communicates truth to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature following is an english translation of the argument however avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation sensation prepares the soul to receive rational concepts from the universal agent intellect the first knowledge of the flying person would be am affirming his or her essence that essence could not be the body obviously as the flying person has no sensation thus the knowledge that am is the core of human being the soul exists and is self aware avicenna thus concluded that the idea of the self is not logically dependent on any physical thing and that the soul should not be seen in relative terms but as primary given substance the body is unnecessary in relation to it the soul is its perfection in itself the soul is an immaterial substance the canon of medicine th century manuscript of the canon kept at the azerbaijan national academy of sciences avicenna authored five volume medical encyclopedia the canon of medicine al qanun fi tibb it was used as the standard medical textbook in the islamic world and europe up to the th century the canon still plays an important role in unani medicine liber primus naturalium avicenna considered whether events like rare diseases or disorders have natural causes he used the example of polydactyly to explain his perception that causal reasons exist for all medical events this view of medical phenomena anticipated developments in the enlightenment by seven centuries the book of healing earth sciences ibn sīnā wrote on earth sciences such as geology in the book of healing while discussing the formation of mountains he explained philosophy of science in the al burhan on demonstration section of the book of healing avicenna discussed the philosophy of science and described an early scientific method of inquiry he discusses aristotle posterior analytics and significantly diverged from it on several points avicenna discussed the issue of proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of how does one acquire the first principles of science he asked how scientist would arrive at the initial axioms or hypotheses of deductive science without inferring them from some more basic premises he explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that relation holds between the terms which would allow for absolute universal certainty avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the first principles the ancient aristotelian method of induction istiqra and the method of examination and experimentation tajriba avicenna criticized aristotelian induction arguing that it does not lead to the absolute universal and certain premises that it purports to provide in its place he develops method of experimentation as means for scientific inquiry logic an early formal system of temporal logic was studied by avicenna although he did not develop real theory of temporal propositions he did study the relationship between temporalis and the implication avicenna work was further developed by najm al dīn al qazwīnī al kātibī and became the dominant system of islamic logic until modern times avicennian logic also influenced several early european logicians such as albertus magnus and william of ockham avicenna endorsed the law of proposed by aristotle that fact could not be both true and false at the same time and in the same sense of the terminology used he stated anyone who denies the law of should be beaten and burned until he admits that to be beaten is not the same as not to be beaten and to be burned is not the same as not to be burned physics in mechanics ibn sīnā in the book of healing developed theory of motion in which he made distinction between the inclination tendency to motion and force of projectile and concluded that motion was result of an inclination mayl transferred to the projectile by the thrower and that projectile motion in vacuum would not cease he viewed inclination as permanent force whose effect is dissipated by external forces such as air resistance the theory of motion presented by avicenna was probably influenced by the th century alexandrian scholar john philoponus avicenna is less sophisticated variant of the theory of impetus developed by buridan in the th century it is unclear if buridan was influenced by avicenna or by philoponus directly in optics ibn sina was among those who argued that light had speed observing that if the perception of light is due to the emission of some sort of particles by luminous source the speed of light must be finite he also provided wrong explanation of the rainbow phenomenon carl benjamin boyer described avicenna ibn sīnā theory on the rainbow as follows in latin text entitled speculum tripartitum stated the following regarding avicenna theory on heat psychology avicenna legacy in classical psychology is primarily embodied in the kitab al nafs parts of his kitab al shifa the book of healing and kitab al najat the book of deliverance these were known in latin under the title de anima treatises on the soul notably avicenna develops what is called the flying man argument in the psychology of the cure as defense of the argument that the soul is without quantitative extension which has an affinity with descartes cogito argument or what phenomenology designates as form of an epoche avicenna psychology requires that connection between the body and soul be strong enough to ensure the soul individuation but weak enough to allow for its immortality avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception thus the philosopher connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception in this way bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect in sense perception the perceiver senses the form of the object first by perceiving features of the object by our external senses this sensory information is supplied to the internal senses which merge all the pieces into whole unified conscious experience this process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body for the material body may only perceive material objects while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial universal forms the way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction which takes place in the physical body the soul completes the action of intellection by accepting forms that have been abstracted from matter this process requires concrete particular material to be abstracted into the universal intelligible immaterial the material and immaterial interact through the active intellect which is divine light containing the intelligible forms the active intellect reveals the universals concealed in material objects much like the sun makes color available to our eyes other contributions astronomy and astrology avicenna wrote an attack on astrology titled resāla fī ebṭāl aḥkām al nojūm in which he cited passages from the quran to dispute the power of astrology to foretell the future he believed that each planet had some influence on the earth but argued against astrologers being able to determine the exact effects avicenna astronomical writings had some influence on later writers although in general his work could be considered less developed than alhazen or al biruni one important feature of his writing is that he considers mathematical astronomy as separate discipline to astrology he criticized aristotle view of the stars receiving their light from the sun stating that the stars are self luminous and believed that the planets are also self luminous he claimed to have observed venus as spot on the sun this is possible as there was transit on may but avicenna did not give the date of his observation and modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time he may have mistaken sunspot for venus he used his transit observation to help establish that venus was at least sometimes below the sun in ptolemaic cosmology the sphere of venus comes before the sphere of the sun when moving out from the earth in the prevailing geocentric model he also wrote the summary of the almagest based on ptolemy almagest with an appended treatise to bring that which is stated in the almagest and what is understood from natural science into conformity for example avicenna considers the motion of the solar apogee which ptolemy had taken to be fixed chemistry ibn sīnā invented steam distillation and used it to produce essential oils such as rose essence forming the foundation of what later became aromatherapy unlike for example al razi ibn sīnā explicitly disputed the theory of the transmutation of substances commonly believed by alchemists four works on alchemy attributed to avicenna were translated into latin as was the most influential having influenced later medieval chemists and alchemists such as vincent of beauvais however anawati argues following ruska that the de anima is fake by spanish author similarly the declaratio is believed not to be actually by avicenna the third work the book of minerals is agreed to be avicenna writing adapted from the kitab al shifa book of the remedy ibn sina classified minerals into stones fusible substances sulfurs and salts building on the ideas of aristotle and jabir the epistola de re recta is somewhat less sceptical of alchemy anawati argues that it is by avicenna but written earlier in his career when he had not yet firmly decided that transmutation was impossible poetry almost half of ibn sīnā works are versified his poems appear in both arabic and persian as an example edward granville browne claims that the following persian verses are incorrectly attributed to omar khayyám and were originally written by ibn sīnā legacy middle ages and renaissance inside view of the avicenna mausoleum designed by hooshang seyhoun in as early as the th century when dante alighieri depicted him in limbo alongside the virtuous non christian thinkers in his divine comedy such as virgil averroes homer horace ovid lucan socrates plato and saladin avicenna has been recognized by both east and west as one of the great figures in intellectual history george sarton the author of the history of science described ibn sīnā as one of the greatest thinkers and medical scholars in history cf dr zahoor and dr haq quotations from famous historians of science cyberistan and called him the most famous scientist of islam and one of the most famous of all races places and times he was one of the islamic world leading writers in the field of medicine along with rhazes abulcasis ibn al nafis and al ibadi ibn sīnā is considered an important compiler of early muslim medicine he is remembered in the western history of medicine as major historical figure who made important contributions to medicine and the european renaissance his medical texts were unusual in that where controversy existed between galen and aristotle views on medical matters such as anatomy he preferred to side with aristotle where necessary updating aristotle position to take into account post aristotelian advances in anatomical knowledge aristotle dominant intellectual influence among medieval european scholars meant that avicenna linking of galen medical writings with aristotle philosophical writings in the canon of medicine along with its comprehensive and logical organisation of knowledge significantly increased avicenna importance in medieval europe in comparison to other islamic writers on medicine his influence following translation of the canon was such that from the early fourteenth to the mid sixteenth centuries he was ranked with hippocrates and galen as one of the acknowledged authorities prince of physicians modern reception in modern iran he is considered national icon and is often regarded as one of the greatest persians to have ever lived monument was erected outside the bukhara

muslim thinkers in many areas including theology philology mathematics astronomy physics and music his works numbered almost volumes on wide range of subjects of which around have survived in particular volumes of his surviving works concentrate on philosophy and of them concentrate on medicine his most famous works are the book of healing and the canon of medicine ibn sīnā wrote at least one treatise on alchemy but several others have been falsely attributed to him his logic metaphysics physics and de caelo are treatises giving synoptic view of aristotelian doctrine though metaphysics demonstrates significant departure from the brand of neoplatonism known as aristotelianism in ibn sīnā world arabic philosophers have hinted at the idea that ibn sīnā was attempting to re aristotelianise muslim philosophy in its entirety unlike his predecessors who accepted the conflation of platonic aristotelian neo and middle platonic works transmitted into the muslim world the logic and metaphysics have been extensively reprinted the latter at venice in and some of his shorter essays on medicine logic etc take poetical form the poem on logic was published by schmoelders in two

amplitude modulation am is modulation technique used in electronic communication most commonly for transmitting information via radio carrier wave in amplitude modulation the amplitude signal strength of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the waveform being transmitted that waveform may for instance correspond to the sounds to be reproduced by loudspeaker or the light intensity of television pixels this technique contrasts with frequency modulation in which the frequency of the carrier signal is varied and phase modulation in which its phase is varied am was the earliest modulation method used to transmit voice by radio it was developed during the first two decades of the th century beginning with landell de moura and reginald fessenden radiotelephone experiments in it remains in use today in many forms of communication for example it is used in portable two way radios vhf aircraft radio citizen band radio and in computer modems in the form of qam am is often used to refer to mediumwave am radio broadcasting fig an audio signal top may be carried by alt animation of audio am and fm modulated carriers forms of amplitude modulation in electronics and modulation means varying some aspect of higher frequency continuous wave carrier signal with an information bearing modulation waveform such as an audio signal which represents sound or video signal which represents images so the carrier will carry the information when it reaches its destination the information signal is extracted from the modulated carrier by demodulation in amplitude modulation the amplitude or strength of the carrier oscillations is what is varied for example in am radio communication continuous wave radio frequency signal sinusoidal carrier wave has its amplitude modulated by an audio waveform before transmission the audio waveform modifies the amplitude of the carrier wave and determines the envelope of the waveform in the frequency domain amplitude modulation produces signal with power concentrated at the carrier frequency and two adjacent sidebands each sideband is equal in bandwidth to that of the modulating signal and is mirror image of the other standard am is thus sometimes called double sideband amplitude modulation dsb am to distinguish it from more sophisticated modulation methods also based on am one disadvantage of all amplitude modulation techniques not only standard am is that the receiver amplifies and detects noise and electromagnetic interference in equal proportion to the signal increasing the received signal to noise ratio say by factor of decibel improvement thus would require increasing the transmitter power by factor of this is in contrast to frequency modulation fm and digital radio where the effect of such noise following demodulation is strongly reduced so long as the received signal is well above the threshold for reception for this reason am broadcast is not favored for music and high fidelity broadcasting but rather for voice communications and broadcasts sports news talk radio etc another disadvantage of am is that it is inefficient in power usage at least two thirds of the power is concentrated in the carrier signal the carrier signal contains none of the original information being transmitted voice video data etc however its presence provides simple means of demodulation using envelope detection providing frequency and phase reference to extract the modulation from the sidebands in some modulation systems based on am lower transmitter power is required through partial or total elimination of the carrier component however receivers for these signals are more complex and costly the receiver may regenerate copy of the carrier frequency usually as shifted to the intermediate frequency from greatly reduced pilot carrier in reduced carrier transmission or dsb rc to use in the demodulation process even with the carrier totally eliminated in double sideband suppressed carrier transmission carrier regeneration is possible using costas phase locked loop this doesn work however for single sideband suppressed carrier transmission ssb sc leading to the characteristic donald duck sound from such receivers when slightly detuned single sideband is nevertheless used widely in amateur radio and other voice communications both due to its power efficiency and bandwidth efficiency cutting the rf bandwidth in half compared to standard am on the other hand in medium wave and short wave broadcasting standard am with the full carrier allows for reception using inexpensive receivers the broadcaster absorbs the extra power cost to greatly increase potential audience an additional function provided by the carrier in standard am but which is lost in either single or double sideband suppressed carrier transmission is that it provides an amplitude reference in the receiver the automatic gain control agc responds to the carrier so that the reproduced audio level stays in fixed proportion to the original modulation on the other hand with suppressed carrier transmissions there is no transmitted power during pauses in the modulation so the agc must respond to peaks of the transmitted power during peaks in the modulation this typically involves so called fast attack slow decay circuit which holds the agc level for second or more following such peaks in between syllables or short pauses in the program this is very acceptable for communications radios where compression of the audio aids intelligibility however it is absolutely undesired for music or normal broadcast programming where faithful reproduction of the original program including its varying modulation levels is expected trivial form of am which can be used for transmitting binary data is on off keying the simplest form of amplitude shift keying in which ones and zeros are represented by the presence or absence of carrier on off keying is likewise used by radio amateurs to transmit morse code where it is known as continuous wave cw operation even though the transmission is not strictly continuous more complex form of am quadrature amplitude modulation is now more commonly used with digital data while making more efficient use of the available bandwidth itu designations in the international union itu designated the types of amplitude modulation designation description double sideband full carrier the basic amplitude modulation scheme single sideband reduced carrier single sideband full carrier single sideband suppressed carrier independent sideband emission vestigial sideband lincompex linked compressor and expander history arc transmitter from the carrier wave is generated by electric arcs in the vertical tubes connected to tuned circuit modulation is done by the large carbon microphone cone shape in the antenna lead one of the first vacuum tube am radio transmitters built by meissner in with an early triode tube by robert von lieben he used it in historic km mi voice transmission from berlin to nauen germany compare its small size with above transmitter although am was used in few crude experiments in multiplex telegraph and telephone transmission in the late the practical development of amplitude modulation is synonymous with the development between and of radiotelephone transmission that is the effort to send sound audio by radio waves the first radio transmitters called spark gap transmitters transmitted information by wireless telegraphy using different length pulses of carrier wave to spell out text messages in morse code they couldn transmit audio because the carrier consisted of strings of damped waves pulses of radio waves that declined to zero that sounded like buzz in receivers in effect they were already amplitude modulated continuous waves the first am transmission was made by canadian researcher reginald fessenden on december using spark gap transmitter with specially designed high frequency khz interrupter over distance of mile km at cobb island maryland usa his first transmitted words were hello one two three four is it snowing where you are mr thiessen the words were barely intelligible above the background buzz of the spark fessenden was significant figure in the development of am radio he was one of the first researchers to realize from experiments like the above that the existing technology for producing radio waves the spark transmitter was not usable for amplitude modulation and that new kind of transmitter one that produced sinusoidal continuous waves was needed this was radical idea at the time because experts believed the impulsive spark was necessary to produce radio frequency waves and fessenden was ridiculed he invented and helped develop one of the first continuous wave transmitters the alexanderson alternator with which he made what is considered the first am public entertainment broadcast on christmas eve he also discovered the principle on which am is based heterodyning and invented one of the first detectors able to rectify and receive am the electrolytic detector or liquid baretter in other radio detectors invented for wireless telegraphy such as the fleming valve and the crystal detector also proved able to rectify am signals so the technological hurdle was generating am waves receiving them was not problem early technologies early experiments in am radio transmission conducted by fessenden valdemar poulsen ernst ruhmer quirino majorana charles harrold and lee de forest were hampered by the lack of technology for amplification the first practical continuous wave am transmitters were based on either the huge expensive alexanderson alternator developed or versions of the poulsen arc transmitter arc converter invented in the modifications necessary to transmit am were clumsy and resulted in very low quality audio modulation was usually accomplished by carbon microphone inserted directly in the antenna or ground wire its varying resistance varied the current to the antenna the limited power handling ability of the microphone severely limited the power of the first radiotelephones many of the microphones were water cooled vacuum tubes the discovery in of the amplifying ability of the audion vacuum tube invented in by lee de forest solved these problems the vacuum tube feedback oscillator invented in by edwin armstrong and alexander meissner was cheap source of continuous waves and could be easily modulated to make an am transmitter modulation did not have to be done at the output but could be applied to the signal before the final amplifier tube so the microphone or other audio source didn have to handle high power wartime research greatly advanced the art of am modulation and after the war the availability of cheap tubes sparked great increase in the number of radio stations experimenting with am transmission of news or music the vacuum tube was responsible for the rise of am radio broadcasting around the first electronic mass entertainment medium amplitude modulation was virtually the only type used for radio broadcasting until fm broadcasting began after world war at the same time as am radio began telephone companies such as at were developing the other large application for am sending multiple telephone calls through single wire by modulating them on separate carrier frequencies called frequency division multiplexing single sideband john renshaw carson in did the first mathematical analysis of amplitude modulation showing that signal and carrier frequency combined in nonlinear device would create two sidebands on either side of the carrier frequency and passing the modulated signal through another nonlinear device would extract the original baseband signal his analysis also showed only one sideband was necessary to transmit the audio signal and carson patented single sideband modulation ssb on december this more advanced variant of amplitude modulation was adopted by at for longwave transatlantic telephone service beginning january after ww it was developed by the military for aircraft communication simplified analysis of standard am illustration of amplitude modulation consider carrier wave sine wave of frequency fc and amplitude given by let represent the modulation waveform for this example we shall take the modulation to be simply sine wave of frequency fm much lower frequency such as an audio frequency than fc where is the amplitude of the modulation we shall insist that then overmodulation occurs and reconstruction of message signal from the transmitted signal would lead in loss of original signal amplitude modulation results when the carrier is multiplied by the positive quantity in this simple case is identical to the modulation index discussed below with the amplitude modulated signal thus corresponds to the top graph labelled modulation in figure using identities can be shown to be the sum of three sine waves therefore the modulated signal has three components the carrier wave which is unchanged and two pure sine waves known as sidebands with frequencies slightly above and below the carrier frequency fc spectrum alt diagrams of an am signal with formulas of course useful modulation signal will generally not consist of single sine wave as treated above however by the principle of fourier decomposition can be expressed as the sum of number of sine waves of various frequencies amplitudes and phases carrying out the multiplication of with as above then yields result consisting of sum of sine waves again the carrier is present unchanged but for each frequency component of at fi there are two sidebands at frequencies fc fi and fc fi the collection of the former frequencies above the carrier frequency is known as the upper sideband and those below constitute the lower sideband in slightly different way of looking at it we can consider the modulation to consist of an equal mix of positive and negative frequency components as results from formal fourier transform of real valued quantity as shown in the top of fig then one can view the sidebands as that modulation having simply been shifted in frequency by fc as depicted at the bottom right of fig formally the modulated signal also contains identical components at negative frequencies shown at the bottom left of fig for completeness fig the alt sonogram of an am signal showing the carrier and both sidebands vertically if we just look at the short term spectrum of modulation changing as it would for human voice for instance then we can plot the frequency content horizontal axis as function of time vertical axis as in fig it can again be seen that as the modulation frequency content varies at any point in time there is an upper sideband generated according to those frequencies shifted above the carrier frequency and the same content mirror imaged in the lower sideband below the carrier frequency at all times the carrier itself remains constant and of greater power than the total sideband power power and spectrum efficiency the rf bandwidth of an am transmission refer to figure but only considering positive frequencies is twice the bandwidth of the modulating or baseband signal since the upper and lower sidebands around the carrier frequency each have bandwidth as wide as the highest modulating frequency although the bandwidth of an am signal is narrower than one using frequency modulation fm it is twice as wide as single sideband techniques it thus may be viewed as spectrally inefficient within frequency band only half as many transmissions or channels can thus be accommodated for this reason analog television employs variant of single sideband known as vestigial sideband somewhat of compromise in terms of bandwidth in order to reduce the required channel spacing another improvement over standard am is obtained through reduction or suppression of the carrier component of the modulated spectrum in figure this is the spike in between the sidebands even with full sine wave modulation the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands yet it carries no unique information thus there is great advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband single sideband suppressed carrier transmission or with both sidebands remaining double sideband suppressed carrier while these suppressed carrier transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power they require more sophisticated receivers employing synchronous detection and regeneration of the carrier frequency for that reason standard am continues to be widely used especially in broadcast transmission to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using envelope detection even analog television with largely suppressed lower sideband includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection but for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent net advantage and are frequently employed modulation index the am modulation index is measure based on the ratio of the modulation excursions of the rf signal to the level of the unmodulated carrier it is thus defined as where and are the modulation amplitude and carrier amplitude respectively the modulation amplitude is the peak positive or negative change in the rf amplitude from its unmodulated value modulation index is normally expressed as percentage and may be displayed on meter connected to an am transmitter so if carrier amplitude varies by above and below its unmodulated level as is shown in the first waveform below for it varies by as shown in the illustration below it with modulation the wave amplitude sometimes reaches zero and this represents full modulation using standard am and is often target in order to obtain the highest possible signal to noise ratio but mustn be exceeded increasing the modulating signal beyond that point known as overmodulation causes standard am modulator see below to fail as the negative excursions of the wave envelope cannot become less than zero resulting in distortion clipping of the received modulation transmitters typically incorporate limiter circuit to avoid overmodulation and or compressor circuit especially for voice communications in order to still approach modulation for maximum intelligibility above the noise such circuits are sometimes referred to as vogad however it is possible to talk about modulation index exceeding without introducing distortion in the case of double sideband reduced carrier transmission in that case negative excursions beyond zero entail reversal of the carrier phase as shown in the third waveform below this cannot be produced using the efficient high level output stage modulation techniques see below which are widely used especially in high power broadcast transmitters rather special modulator produces such waveform at low level followed by linear amplifier what more standard am receiver using an envelope detector is incapable of properly demodulating such signal rather synchronous detection is required thus double sideband transmission is generally not referred to as am even though it generates an identical rf waveform as standard am as long as the modulation index is below such systems more often attempt radical reduction of the carrier level compared to the sidebands where the useful information is present to the point of double sideband suppressed carrier transmission where the carrier is ideally reduced to zero in all such cases the term modulation index loses its value as it refers to the ratio of the modulation amplitude to rather small or zero remaining carrier amplitude alt graphs illustrating how signal intelligibility increases with modulation index but only up to using standard am modulation methods anode plate modulation tetrode plate and screen grid voltage is modulated via an audio transformer the resistor sets the grid bias both the input and output are tuned circuits with inductive coupling modulation circuit designs may be classified as low or high level depending on whether they modulate in low power domain followed by amplification for transmission or in the high power domain of the transmitted signal low level generation in modern radio systems modulated signals are generated via digital signal processing dsp with dsp many types of am are possible with software control including dsb with carrier ssb suppressed carrier and independent sideband or isb calculated digital samples are converted to voltages with digital to analog converter typically at frequency less than the desired rf output frequency the analog signal must then be shifted in frequency and linearly amplified to the desired frequency and power level linear amplification must be used to prevent modulation distortion this low level method for am is used in many amateur radio transceivers am may also be generated at low level using analog methods described in the next section high level generation high power am transmitters such as those used for am broadcasting are based on high efficiency class and class power amplifier stages modulated by varying the supply voltage older designs for broadcast and amateur radio also generate am by controlling the gain of the transmitter final amplifier generally class for efficiency the following types are for vacuum tube transmitters but similar options are available with transistors plate modulation in plate modulation the plate voltage of the rf amplifier is modulated with the audio signal the audio power requirement is percent of the rf carrier power heising constant current modulation rf amplifier plate voltage is fed through choke high value inductor the am modulation tube plate is fed through the same inductor so the modulator tube diverts current from the rf amplifier the choke acts as constant current source in the audio range this system has low power efficiency control grid modulation the operating bias and gain of the final rf amplifier can be controlled by varying the voltage of the control grid this method requires little audio power but care must be taken to reduce distortion clamp tube screen grid modulation the screen grid bias may be controlled through clamp tube which reduces voltage according to the modulation signal it is difficult to approach percent modulation while maintaining low distortion with this system doherty modulation one tube provides the power under carrier conditions and another operates only for positive modulation peaks overall efficiency is good and distortion is low outphasing modulation two tubes are operated in parallel but partially out of phase with each other as they are differentially phase modulated their combined amplitude is greater or smaller efficiency is good and distortion low when properly adjusted pulse width modulation pwm or pulse duration modulation pdm highly efficient high voltage power supply is applied to the tube plate the output voltage of this supply is varied at an audio rate to follow the program this system was pioneered by hilmer swanson and has number of variations all of which achieve high efficiency and sound quality demodulation methods the simplest form of am demodulator consists of diode which is configured to act as envelope detector another type of demodulator the product detector can provide better quality demodulation with additional circuit

ardipithecus is genus of an extinct hominine that lived during late miocene and early pliocene in afar depression ethiopia originally described as one of the earliest ancestors of humans after they diverged from the main ape lineage the relation of this genus to human ancestors and whether it is hominin is now matter of debate two fossil species are described in the literature ramidus which lived about million years ago during the early pliocene and kadabba dated to approximately million years ago late miocene behavioral analysis showed that ardipithecus could be very similar to chimpanzees indicating that the early human ancestors were very chimpanzee like in behaviour ardipithecus ramidus ramidus was named in september the first fossil found was dated to million years ago on the basis of its stratigraphic position between two volcanic strata the basal gaala tuff complex and the daam aatu basaltic tuff the name ardipithecus ramidus stems mostly from the afar language in which ardi means ground floor borrowed from the semitic root in either amharic or arabic and ramid means root the pithecus portion of the name is from the greek word for ape like most hominids but unlike all previously recognized hominins it had grasping hallux or big toe adapted for locomotion in the trees it is not confirmed how much other features of its skeleton reflect adaptation to bipedalism on the ground as well like later hominins ardipithecus had reduced canine teeth in research team headed by tim white discovered the first ramidus fossils seventeen fragments including skull mandible teeth and arm bones from the afar depression in the middle awash river valley of ethiopia more fragments were recovered in amounting to of the total skeleton this fossil was originally described as species of but white and his colleagues later published note in the same journal renaming the fossil under new genus ardipithecus between and team led by sileshi semaw discovered bones and teeth of nine ramidus individuals at as duma in the gona western margin of ethiopia afar region the fossils were dated to between and million years old map showing discovery locations ardipithecus ramidus had small brain measuring between and cm this is slightly smaller than modern bonobo or female common chimpanzee brain but much smaller than the brain of like lucy to cm and roughly the size of the modern homo sapiens brain like common chimpanzees ramidus was much more prognathic than modern humans the teeth of ramidus lacked the specialization of other apes and suggest that it was generalized omnivore and frugivore fruit eater with diet that did not depend heavily on foliage fibrous plant material roots tubers etc or hard and or abrasive food the size of the upper canine tooth in ramidus males was not distinctly different from that of females their upper canines were less sharp than those of modern common chimpanzees in part because of this decreased upper canine size as larger upper canines can be honed through wear against teeth in the lower mouth the features of the upper canine in ramidus contrast with the sexual dimorphism observed in common chimpanzees where males have significantly larger and sharper upper canine teeth than females the less pronounced nature of the upper canine teeth in ramidus has been used to infer aspects of the social behavior of the species and more ancestral hominids in particular it has been used to suggest that the last common ancestor of hominids and african apes was characterized by relatively little aggression between males and between groups this is markedly different from social patterns in common chimpanzees among which intermale and intergroup aggression are typically high researchers in study said that this condition compromises the living chimpanzee as behavioral model for the ancestral hominid condition ramidus existed more recently than the most recent common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees clca or pan homo lca and thus is not fully representative of that common ancestor nevertheless it is in some ways unlike chimpanzees suggesting that the common ancestor differs from the modern chimpanzee after the chimpanzee and human lineages diverged both underwent substantial evolutionary change chimp feet are specialized for grasping trees ramidus feet are better suited for walking the canine teeth of ramidus are smaller and equal in size between males and females which suggests reduced male to male conflict increased pair bonding and increased parental investment thus fundamental reproductive and social behavioral changes probably occurred in hominids long before they had enlarged brains and began to use stone tools the research team concluded ardi on october paleontologists formally announced the discovery of the relatively complete ramidus fossil skeleton first unearthed in the fossil is the remains of small brained kilogram lb female nicknamed ardi and includes most of the skull and teeth as well as the pelvis hands and feet it was discovered in ethiopia harsh afar desert at site called aramis in the middle awash region radiometric dating of the layers of volcanic ash encasing the deposits suggest that ardi lived about million years ago this date however has been questioned by others fleagle and kappelman suggest that the region in which ardi was found is difficult to date radiometrically and they argue that ardi should be dated at million years the fossil is regarded by its describers as shedding light on stage of human evolution about which little was known more than million years before lucy afarensis the iconic early human ancestor candidate who lived million years ago and was discovered in just away from ardi discovery site however because the ardi skeleton is no more than years older than the earliest fossils of and may in fact be younger than they are some researchers doubt that it can represent direct ancestor of some researchers infer from the form of her pelvis and limbs and the presence of her abductable hallux that ardi was facultative biped bipedal when moving on the ground but quadrupedal when moving about in tree branches ramidus had more primitive walking ability than later hominids and could not walk or run for long distances the teeth suggest omnivory and are more generalised than those of modern apes file ardipithecus finger bones jpg casts of ardi finger bones file jpeg the recovered fragments of ardi skeleton file ardipithecus ramidus artistic reconstruction jpg scientific paleoartist jay matternes rendition of ardi ardipithecus kadabba ardipithecus kadabba fossils ardipithecus kadabba is known only from teeth and bits and pieces of skeletal bones and is dated to approximately million years ago it has been described as probable chronospecies ancestor of ramidus although originally considered subspecies of ramidus in anthropologists yohannes haile selassie gen suwa and tim white published an article elevating kadabba to species level on the basis of newly discovered teeth from ethiopia these teeth show primitive morphology and wear pattern which demonstrate that kadabba is distinct species from ramidus the specific name comes from the afar word for basal family ancestor life style the toe and pelvic structure of ramidus suggest to some researchers that the organism walked erect according to scott simpson the gona project physical anthropologist the fossil evidence from the middle awash indicates that both kadabba and ramidus lived in mosaic of woodland and grasslands with lakes swamps and springs nearby but further research is needed to determine which habitat ardipithecus at gona preferred alternative views and further studies due to several shared characters with chimpanzees its closeness to ape divergence period and due to its fossil incompleteness the exact position of ardipithecus in the fossil record is subject of controversy independent researcher such as esteban sarmiento of the human evolution foundation in new jersey had systematically compared in the identifying characters of apes and human ancestral fossils in relation to ardipithecus and concluded that the comparison data is not sufficient to support an exclusive human lineage sarmiento noted that ardipithecus does not share any characters exclusive to humans and some of its characters those in the wrist and basicranium suggest it diverged from the common human african ape stock prior to the human chimpanzee and gorilla divergence his comparative narrow allometry study in on the molar and body segment lengths which included living primates of similar body size noted that some dimensions including short upper limbs and metacarpals are reminiscent of humans but other dimensions such as long toes and relative molar surface area are great ape like sarmiento concluded that such length measures can change back and forth during evolution and are not very good indicators of relatedness the ardipithecus length measures however are good indicators of function and together with dental isotope data and the fauna and flora from the fossil site indicate ardipithecus was mainly terrestrial quadruped collecting large portion of its food on the ground its arboreal behaviors would have been limited and suspension from branches solely from the upper limbs rare however some later studies still argue for its classification in the human lineage comparative study in on carbon and oxygen stable isotopes within modern and fossil tooth enamel revealed that ardipithecus fed both arboreally on trees and on the ground in more open habitat unlike chimpanzees and extinct ape sivapithecus thereby differentiating them from other apes in it was reported that the hand bones of ardipithecus sediba and afarensis consist of distinct human lineage feature which is the presence of third metacarpal styloid process that is absent in other ape lineages unique brain organisations such as lateral shift of the carotid foramina mediolateral abbreviation of the lateral tympanic and shortened trapezoidal basioccipital element in ardipithecus are also found only and homo clade comparison of the tooth root morphology with those of sahelanthropus tchadensis also indicated strong resemblance implying its correct inclusion in human lineage in study that assumes the hominin status of ardipithecus ramidus it has been argued the species represents heterochronic alteration of the more general great ape body plan in this study the resemblance of the species craniofacial moprhology with that of subadult chimpanzees is attributed to dissociation of craniofacial growth from brain growth and associated life history trajectories such as eruption of the first molar and age of first birth consequently it is argued the species represents unique ontogeny unlike any extant ape the reduced growth in the sub nasal alveolar region of the face which houses the projecting canine complex in chimpanzees suggests the species had rates of growth and reproductive biology unlike any living primate species in this sense the species may show the first trend towards human social parenting and sexual psychology consequently the authors argue it is no longer tenable to extrapolate from chimpanzees in reconstructions of early hominin social and mating behaviour providing further evidence against the so called chimpanzee referential model as the authors write when discussing the species unusual pattern of cranio dental growth and the light it may throw on the origins of human sociality the contrast of humans with chimpanzees is instructive for when humans start developing broader social bonds after the permanent dentition begins erupting at the same developmental milestone chimpanzee facial projection increases in other words humans seem to have replaced craniofacial growth with an extended and intensified period of socio emotional development as ramidus no longer has an ontogeny that results in the development of prognathic jaw with complex which is one of the most important means by which males vie for status within the mating hierarchies of other primate species young and sub adult members of the species must have pursued other avenues by which to become reproductively successful members of the social group the implication of these interspecific differences is that ramidus would have most likely had period of infant and juvenile socialisation different from that of chimpanzees consequently it is possible that in ramidus we see the first albeit incipient trend toward human forms of child socialisation and social organisation it should be noted that this view has yet to be corroborated by more detailed studies of the ontogeny of ramidus the study also provides support for stephen jay gould theory in ontogeny and phylogeny that the paedomorphic form of early hominin craniofacial morphology results from heterochronic dissociation of growth trajectories ardipithecus ramidus and the evolution of human vocal ability study published in homo journal of comparative human biology in claims that ramidus possessed an ontogeny and idiosyncratic skull morphology more conducive to the production of modulated vocalisations than any other species of extant great ape this paper argued that erect posture significant cervical lordosis reduced facial projection as well as flexed cranial base architecture indicate this species possessed greater facility to modulate vocalisations than both chimpanzees and bonobos this is controversial finding as it pushes language origins back some ma into the late miocene and early pliocene suggesting that human vocal capability may have much deeper roots in the hominin lineage than traditionally supposed in integrating data on anatomical correlates of primate mating and social systems with studies of skull and vocal tract architecture that facilitate speech production the authors argue that to date have failed to grasp the important relationship between early hominin social evolution and language capacity as they write while the skull of ramidus according to the authors lacks the anatomical impediments to speech evident in chimpanzees it is unclear what the vocal capabilities of this early hominin were while they suggest ramidus based on similar vocal tract ratios may have had vocal capabilities equivalent to modern human infant or very young child they concede this is obviously debatable and specualtive hypothesis however they do claim that changes in skull architecture through processes of social selection were necessary prerequisite for language evolution as they write see also ardi chimpanzee human last common ancestor lucy

the brazilian forró accordionist dominguinhos accordions from th century german akkordeon from akkord musical chord concord of sounds are family of box shaped musical instruments of the bellows driven free reed aerophone type colloquially referred to as squeezebox person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist the concertina and bandoneón are related the harmonium and american reed organ are in the same family the instrument is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or keys causing pallets to open which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel called reeds these vibrate to produce sound inside the body valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block the performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right hand manual and the accompaniment consisting of bass and pre set chord buttons on the left hand manual the accordion is widely spread across the world in some countries for example brazil colombia and mexico it is used in popular music for example forró sertanejo and pop in brazil whereas in other regions such as europe north america and other countries in south america it tends to be more used for dance pop and folk music and as well as in regional and is often used in folk music in europe north america and south america nevertheless in europe and north america some popular music acts also make use of the instrument additionally the accordion is also used in cajun zydeco jazz music and in both solo and orchestra performances of classical music the piano accordion is the official city instrument of san francisco california many conservatories in europe have classical accordion departments the oldest name for this group of instruments is harmonika from the greek harmonikos meaning harmonic musical today native versions of the name accordion are more common these names refer to the type of accordion patented by cyrill demian which concerned automatically coupled chords on the bass side construction diatonic button accordion being played accordions have many configurations and types what may be technically possible to do with one accordion could be impossible with another some accordions are bisonoric producing different pitches depending on the direction of bellows movement others are unisonoric and produce the same pitch in both directions the pitch also depends on its size some use chromatic buttonboard for the right hand manual others use diatonic buttonboard for the right hand manual yet others use piano style musical keyboard for the right hand manual some can play in different registers craftsmen and technicians may tune the same registers differently personalizing the end result such as an organ technician might voice particular instrument universal components bellows the bellows is the most recognizable part of the instrument and the primary means of articulation similar to violin bow the production of sound in an accordion is in direct proportion to the motion of the player the bellows is located between the right and left hand manuals and is made from pleated layers of cloth and cardboard with added leather and metal it is used to create pressure and vacuum driving air across the internal reeds and producing sound by their vibration applied pressure increasing the volume the keyboard touch is not expressive and does not affect dynamics all expression is effected through the bellows some bellows effects as illustrated below bellows used for volume control fade repeated change of direction bellows shake which has been popularized by luiz gonzaga and is extensively used in forró and called resfulengo in brazil constant bellows motion while applying pressure at intervals constant bellows motion to produce clear tones with no resonance using the bellows with the silent air button gives the sound of air moving which is sometimes used in contemporary compositions particularly for this instrument body the accordion body consists of two wood boxes joined together by the bellows these boxes house reed chambers for the right and left hand manuals respectively each side has grilles in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument and to allow the sound to better project the grille for the right hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes the right hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left hand manual for playing the accompaniment however skilled players can reverse these roles the size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type layout and playing range which can be as small as to have only one or two rows of basses and single octave on the right hand manual to the standard bass accordion and through to large and heavy bass free bass converter models pallet mechanism the accordion is an aerophone the manual mechanism of the instrument either enables the air flow or disables it side view of the pallet mechanism in piano accordion as the key is pressed down the pallet is lifted allowing for air to enter the tone chamber in either direction and excite the reeds air flow direction depends on the direction of bellows movement similar mechanical pallet movement is used in button accordions as well as for bass mechanisms such as the stradella bass machine that translates single button press into multiple pallet openings for the notes of chord variable components there is wide range of instruments that are called accordion the different types have varying components all instruments have reed ranks of some format not all have switches the most typical accordion is the piano accordion which is used for many musical genres another type of accordion is the button accordion which is used in several musical traditions including cajun conjunto and tejano music swiss and austro german alpine music argentinian tango music and many other folk genres right hand manual systems weltmeister piano accordion different systems exist for the right hand manual of an accordion which is normally used for playing the melody some use button layout arranged in one way or another while others use piano style keyboard each system has different claimed benefits by those who prefer it they are also used to define one accordion or another as different type chromatic button accordions and the bayan russian variant use buttonboard where notes are arranged chromatically two major systems exist referred to as the system and the system there are also regional variants diatonic button accordions use buttonboard designed around the notes of diatonic scales in small number of keys the keys are often arranged in one row for each key available chromatic scales may be available by combining notes from different rows the adjective diatonic is also commonly used to describe bisonic or bisonoric accordions that is instruments whose right hand manual and in some instances even bass keys each sound two different notes depending on the direction of the bellows for instance producing major triad sequences while closing the bellows and dominant seventh or while opening such is the case for instance with the argentinian bandoneon the austro german steirische harmonika the italian organetto the swiss schwyzerörgeli and the anglo concertina piano accordions use musical keyboard similar to piano at right angles to the cabinet the tops of the keys inward toward the bellows plus accordions use buttonboard with three rows of buttons in uniform or whole tone arrangement the chromatic scale consists of two rows the third row is repetition of the first row so there is the same fingering in all twelve scales these accordions are produced only in special editions the logicordion produced by harmona left hand manual systems typical button stradella bass system this is the left hand manual system found on most unisonoric accordions today different systems are also in use for the left hand manual which is normally used for playing the accompaniment these almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing there are three general categories the stradella bass system also called standard bass is arranged in circle of fifths and uses single buttons for chords the belgian bass system is variation used in belgian chromatic accordions it is also arranged in circle of fifths but in reverse order this system has rows of basses rows of chord buttons allowing easier fingering for playing melodies combined chords better use of fingers and and more space between the buttons this system was poorly traded outside of native belgium various free bass systems for greater access to playing melodies on the left hand manual and to forming one own chords these are often chosen for playing jazz and classical music some models can convert between free bass and stradella bass this is called converter bass the free bass left hand notes are arranged chromatically in three rows with one additional duplicate row of buttons reed ranks and switches reed ranks with closeup of reeds inside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones these are organized in different sounding banks which can be further combined into registers producing differing timbres all but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate organized from high to low registers each register stop produces separate sound timbre see the accordion reed ranks and switches article for further explanation and audio samples all but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches the larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches classification of chromatic and piano type accordions in describing pricing an accordion the first factor is size expressed in number of keys on either side for piano type this could for one example be meaning keys octaves plus one note on the treble side and bass keys after size the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side either on cassotto or not and to lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches typically these could be announced as reeds meaning five reeds on the treble side and three on the bass and registers meaning register buttons on the treble side plus special master that activates all ranks like the tutti on an organ and seven register switches on the bass side accordion player in street in the historic centre of quito ecuador straps the larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller squeezeboxes and are equipped with two shoulder straps to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting and avoid dropping the instrument while standing other accordions such as the diatonic button accordion have only single shoulder strap and right hand thumb strap all accordions have mostly adjustable leather strap on the left hand manual to keep the player hand in position while drawing the bellows there are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing unusual accordions garmon player various hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions many remain curiosities only few have remained in use the schrammel accordion used in viennese chamber music and klezmer which has the treble buttonboard of chromatic button accordion and bisonoric bass buttonboard similar to an expanded diatonic button accordion the steirische harmonika is type of bisonoric diatonic button accordion particular to the alpine folk music of austria the czech republic slovenia the german state of bavaria and the italian south tyrol the schwyzerörgeli or swiss organ which usually has row diatonic treble and unisonoric bass buttons in bass chord arrangement subset of the stradella system in reverse order like the belgian bass that travel parallel to the bellows motion the trikitixa of the basque people has two row diatonic bisonoric treble and button diatonic unisonoric bass in scotland the favoured diatonic accordion is the instrument known as the british chromatic accordion while the right hand is bisonoric the left hand follows the stradella system the elite form of this instrument is generally considered the german manufactured shand morino produced by hohner with the input of sir jimmy shand type of accordion used sometimes in polish folk music has pair of pump organ like bellows attached history the accordion is free reed instrument and is in the same family as other instruments such as the sheng and khaen the sheng and khaen are both much older than the accordion and this type of reed did inspire the kind of free reeds in use in the accordion as we know it today key bisonoric diatonic accordion the accordion basic form is believed to have been invented in berlin in by christian friedrich ludwig buschmann although one instrument has been recently discovered that appears to have been built earlier zitat dillner akkordeon the earliest history of the accordion in russia is poorly documented nevertheless according to russian researchers the earliest known simple accordions were made in tula russia by timofey vorontsov from and ivan sizov from by the late the instrument was already very widespread together the factories of the two masters were producing instruments year by over instruments were being produced yearly by tula and neighbouring villages and by the yearly production rate was over by the novgorod vyatka and saratov governorates also had significant accordion production by the the list included oryol ryazan moscow tver vologda kostroma nizhny novgorod simbirsk and others and many of these places created their own varieties of the instrument the accordion is one of several european inventions of the early th century that used free reeds driven by bellows an instrument called accordion was first patented in by cyrill demian of armenian origin in vienna demian instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments it only had left hand buttonboard with the right hand simply operating the bellows one key feature for which demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key his instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key one for each bellows direction bisonoric action the piano accordion was first played in german speaking regions and then spread over europe some early portable instrument with piano keys had been invented in but it started to actually be played much later and built its reputation from there at that time in vienna mouth harmonicas with kanzellen chambers had already been available for many years along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows the diatonic key arrangement was also already in use on mouth blown instruments demian patent thus covered an accompanying instrument an accordion played with the left hand opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played small and light enough for travelers to take with them and used to accompany singing the patent also described instruments with both bass and treble sections although demian preferred the bass only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages by at least the accordion had appeared in britain the instrument was noted in the times of that year as one new to british audiences and not favourably reviewed but nevertheless it soon became popular it had also become popular with new yorkers by the mid at the latest after demian invention other accordions appeared some featuring only the righthanded keyboard for playing melodies it took english inventor charles wheatstone to squeeze both chords and keyboard together in one squeezebox his patent for what he called concertina also featured the ability to easily tune the reeds from the outside with simple tool the first pages in adolph müller accordion book the musician adolph müller described great variety of instruments in his book schule für accordion at the time vienna and london had close musical relationship with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year so it is possible that wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key arrangement ideas into practice jeune flutina resembles wheatstone concertina in internal construction and tone color but it appears to complement demian accordion functionally the flutina is one sided bisonoric melody only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left when the two instruments are combined the result is quite similar to diatonic button accordions still manufactured today further innovations followed and continue to the present various buttonboard and keyboard systems have been developed as well as voicings the combination of multiple tones at different octaves with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance and different methods of internal construction to improve tone stability and durability use in various music genres the accordion has traditionally been used to perform folk or ethnic music popular music and transcriptions from the operatic and light classical music repertoire today the instrument is sometimes heard in contemporary pop styles such as rock pop rock etc and occasionally even in serious classical music concerts as well as advertisements use in traditional music invented in its popularity spread rapidly it has mostly been associated with the common people and was spread by europeans who emigrated around the world the accordion in both button and piano forms became favorite of folk musicians and has been integrated into traditional music styles all over the world see the list of music styles that incorporate the accordion this is button key accordion made by the company marrazza in italy it was brought by italian immigrants to australia as reminder of their homeland use in popular music the accordion appeared in popular music from the to the this half century is often called the golden age of the accordion five players pietro frosini the two brothers count guido deiro and pietro deiro and slovenian brothers vilko ovsenik and slavko avsenik charles magnante were major influences at this time most vaudeville theaters closed during the great depression but accordionists during the taught and performed for radio included among this group was the concert virtuoso john serry sr during the through the the accordion received significant exposure on television with performances by myron floren on the lawrence welk show in the late and early the accordion declined in popularity due to the rise of rock roll the first accordionist to appear and perform at the newport jazz festival was angelo dipippo he can be seen playing his accordion in the motion picture the godfather he also composed and performed with his accordion on part of the soundtrack of woody allen movie to rome with love he was featured twice on the tonight show with johnny carson folk accordionist richard galliano is an internationally known jazz accordionist some popular acts do use the instrument in their distinctive sounds notable example is grammy award winning parodist weird al yankovic who plays the accordion on many of his musical tracks particularly his polkas yankovic was trained in the accordion as child use in classical music although best known as folk instrument it has grown in popularity among classical composers the earliest surviving concert piece is written in by miss louise reisner of paris other composers including the russian pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky the italian umberto giordano and the american charles ives wrote works for the diatonic button accordion the first composer to write specifically for the chromatic accordion was paul hindemith in the austrian alban berg included an accordion in wozzeck op in the first accordion concerto was composed in russia other notable composers have written for the accordion during the first half of the th century american composer william perry featured the accordion in his orchestral suite six title themes in search of movie the experimental composer howard skempton began his musical career as an accordionist and has written numerous solo works for it in his work drang british composer john palmer has pushed the expressive possibilities of the accordion bayan to the limits of virtuosity luciano berio wrote sequenza xiii for accordionist teodoro anzellotti accordionists like mogens ellegaard joseph macerollo friedrich lips hugo noth stefan hussong teodoro anzellotti mie miki geir draugsvoll encouraged composers to write new music for the accordion solo and chamber music and also started playing baroque music bach scarlatti on the free bass accordion french composer henri dutilleux used an accordion in both his late song cycles correspondances and le temps horloge russian born composer sofia gubaidulina has composed solos concertos and chamber works for accordion astor piazzolla concert tangos are performed widely piazzolla performed on the bandoneon but his works can be performed on either bandoneon or accordion bosnia and herzegovina the accordion is traditional instrument in bosnia and herzegovina it is the dominant instrument used in sevdalinka traditional genre of folk music from bosnia herzegovina it is also considered national instrument of the country brazil the accordion is widely used in brazil in traditional as well as pop music compared to many other countries the instrument enjoys in brazil high popularity in mainstream pop music in some parts of the country such as the north east it is the most popular melodic instrument as opposed to most european folk very dry tuning is usually used in brazil the accordion predominantly the piano accordion is used in almost all styles of forró in particular in the subgenres of xote and baião as principal instrument luiz gonzaga the king of the baião and dominguinhos being among the notable musicians in this style in this musical style the typical combination is trio of accordion triangle and zabumba type of drum this style has gained popularity recently in particular among the student population of the south east of the country in the forró universitário genre with important exponents today being falamansa and trios such as trio dona zefa trio virgulino and trio alvorada moreover the accordion is the principal instrument in junina music music of the são joão festival with mario zan having been very important exponent of this music it is an important instrument in sertanejo and caipira music which originated in the centre west and south east of brazil and subsequently has gained popularity throughout the country in the south of the country where there is preponderance of the button accordion in particular in rio grande do sul it used in the brazilian gaúcho musical style an important exponent of this music being renato borghetti colombia the accordion is also traditional instrument in colombia commonly associated with the vallenato and cumbia genres the accordion has been used by tropipop musicians such as carlos vives andrés cabas fonseca singer and bacilos as well as rock musicians such as juanes and pop musicians as shakira vallenato which emerged in the early twentieth century in city known as valledupar has come to symbolize the folk music of colombia the legend of the accordion arrival in colombia comes from story of ship wreck that was coming from germany to argentina the wreck happened over the magdalena river in the atlantic coast every year in april colombia holds one of the most important musical festivals in the country the vallenato legend festival the festival holds contests for best accordion player once every decade the king of kings accordion competition takes place when winners of the previous festivals compete for the highest possible award for vallenato accordion player the pilonera mayor prize this is the world largest competitive accordion festival mexico norteño heavily relies on the accordion it is genre related to polka ramón ayala known in mexico as the king of the accordion is norteño musician cumbia which features the accordion is also popular with musicians such as celso piña creating more contemporary style born mexican musician julieta venegas incorporates the sound of the instrument into rock pop and folk she was influenced by her fellow chicanos los lobos who also use the music of the accordion north korea the accordion is widely taught in north korea it is known as the national instrument all north korean student are expected to learn the accordion throughout their elementary and secondary education on kim jong il birthday the most important public holiday in north korea revolutionary songs like sea of blood and song of comradeship are often played on the accordion use in heavy metal music accordionists in heavy metal make their most extensive appearances in the folk metal subgenre and are otherwise generally rare full time accordionists in folk metal seem even rarer but they are still utilized for studio work as flexible keyboardists are usually more accessible for live performances notably the finnish symphonic folk metal band turisas used to have full time accordionist employing classical and polka style sensibilities alongside violinist one of their accordionists netta skog is now member of ensiferum another folk metal band another finnish metal band korpiklaani invokes type of finnish polka called humppa and also has full time accordionist sarah kiener the former hurdy gurdy player for the swiss melodic death folk metal band eluveitie played helvetic accordion known as zugerörgeli which could be distant relative in one way or another to the swiss schwyzerörgeli as both are indigenous to and very rare outside of switzerland manufacturing process the best accordions are always fully hand made particularly the reeds completely hand made reeds have far better tonal quality than even the best automatically manufactured ones some accordions have been modified by individuals striving to bring more pure sound out of low end instruments such as the ones improved by yutaka usui japanese born craftsman the manufacture of an accordion is only partly automated process in sense all accordions are handmade since there is always some hand assembly of the small parts required the general process involves making the individual parts assembling the subsections assembling the entire instrument and final decorating and packaging famous centres of production are the italian cities of stradella and castelfidardo with many small and medium size manufacturers especially at the latter castelfidardo honours the memory of paolo soprani who was one of the first large scale producers the french town of tulle has hosted maugein freres since and the company is now the last complete process manufacturer of accordions in france german companies such as hohner and weltmeister made large numbers of accordions but production had diminished by the end of the th century hohner still manufactures its top end models in germany and weltmeister instruments are still handmade by harmona akkordeon gmbh in klingenthal cheaper student models are often made in china

agrarianism is social philosophy or political philosophy which values rural society as superior to urban society the independent farmer as superior to the paid worker and sees farming as way of life that can shape the ideal social values it stresses the superiority of simpler rural life as opposed to the complexity of city life philosophy thomas inge defines agrarianism by the following basic tenets farming is the sole occupation that offers total independence and self sufficiency urban life capitalism and technology destroy independence and dignity and foster vice and weakness the agricultural community with its fellowship of labor and co operation is the model society the farmer has solid stable position in the world order he has sense of identity sense of historical and religious tradition feeling of belonging to concrete family place and region which are psychologically and culturally beneficial the harmony of his life checks the encroachments of fragmented alienated modern society cultivation of the soil has within it positive spiritual good and from it the cultivator acquires the virtues of honor manliness self reliance courage moral integrity and hospitality they result from direct contact with nature and through nature closer relationship to god the agrarian is blessed in that he follows the example of god in creating order out of chaos history the philosophical roots of agrarianism include european and chinese philosophers the chinese school of agriculturalism 农家 農家 was philosophy that advocated peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism in societies influenced by confucianism the farmer was considered an esteemed productive member of society but merchants who made money were looked down upon that influenced european intellectuals like françois quesnay an avid confucianist and advocate of china agrarian policies in forming the french agrarian philosophy of physiocracy the physiocrats along with the ideas of john locke and the romantic era formed the basis of modern european and american agrarianism united states president thomas jefferson was representative agrarian who built jeffersonian democracy around the notion that farmers are the most valuable citizens and the truest republicans agrarian parties peasant parties first appeared across eastern europe between and when commercialized agriculture and world market forces disrupted traditional rural society and the railway and growing literacy facilitated the work of roving organizers agrarian parties advocated land reforms to redistribute land on large estates among those who work it they also wanted village cooperatives to keep the profit from crop sales in local hands and credit institutions to underwrite needed improvements many peasant parties were also nationalist parties because peasants often worked their land for the benefit of landlords of different ethnicity peasant parties rarely had any power before world war but some became influential in the interwar era especially in bulgaria and czechoslovakia for while in the and the there was green international international agrarian bureau based on the peasant parties in bulgaria czechoslovakia poland and serbia it functioned primarily as an information center that spread the ideas of agrarianism and combating socialism on the left and landlords on the right and never launched any significant activities africa tunisia the farmers voice party won seat in the district of jendouba after the parliamentary election of europe bulgaria in bulgaria the bulgarian agrarian national union bzns was organized in to resist taxes and build cooperatives bzns came to power in and introduced many economic social and legal reforms however conservative forces crushed bzns in coup and

and mixes them with strong nationalist sentiments oceania australia historian crowley finds that australian farmers and their spokesman have always considered that life on the land is inherently more virtuous as well as more healthy more important and more productive than life in the towns and cities the farmers complained that something was wrong with an electoral system which produced who spent money beautifying vampire cities instead of developing the interior the national party of australia formerly called the country party from the to the promulgated its version of agrarianism which it called the goal was to enhance the status of the graziers operators of big sheep ranches and small farmers and justified subsidies for them new zealand the new zealand liberal party aggressively promoted agrarianism in its heyday the landed gentry and aristocracy ruled britain at this time new zealand never had an aristocracy but its wealthy landowners largely controlled politics before the liberal party set out to change that by policy it called populism richard seddon had proclaimed the goal as early as it is the rich and the poor it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and labouring classes that sir shows the real political position of new zealand the liberal strategy was to create large class of small landowning farmers who supported liberal ideals the liberal government also established the basis of the later welfare state such as old age pensions and developed system for settling industrial disputes which was accepted by both employers and trade unions in it extended voting rights to women making new zealand the first country in the world to do so to obtain land for farmers the liberal government from to purchased of maori land the government also purchased from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small farmers the advances to settlers act provided low interest mortgages and the agriculture department disseminated information on the best farming methods the liberals proclaimed success in forging an egalitarian anti monopoly land policy the policy built up support for the liberal party in rural north island electorates by the liberals were so dominant that there was no longer an organized opposition in parliament back to the land movement agrarianism is similar to but not identical with the back to the land movement agrarianism concentrates on the fundamental goods of the earth on communities of more limited economic and political scale than in modern society and on simple living even when the shift involves questioning the progressive character of some recent social and economic developments thus agrarianism is not industrial farming with its specialization on products and industrial scale see

alan mathison turing june june was an english computer scientist mathematician logician cryptanalyst philosopher and theoretical biologist turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science providing formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the turing machine which can be considered model of general purpose computer turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence during the second world war turing worked for the government code and cypher school gc cs at bletchley park britain codebreaking centre that produced ultra intelligence for time he led hut the section which was responsible for german naval cryptanalysis here he devised number of techniques for speeding the breaking of german ciphers including improvements to the pre war polish bombe method an machine that could find settings for the enigma machine turing played pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the allies to defeat the nazis in many crucial engagements including the battle of the atlantic and in so doing helped win the war counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect ultra intelligence had on the length of the war but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives after the war turing worked at the national physical laboratory where he designed the ace among the first designs for stored program computer in turing joined max newman computing machine laboratory at the victoria university of manchester where he helped develop the manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology he wrote paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the belousov zhabotinsky reaction first observed in the turing was prosecuted in for homosexual acts when by the labouchere amendment gross indecency was criminal in the uk he accepted chemical castration treatment with des as an alternative to prison turing died in days before his nd birthday from cyanide poisoning an inquest determined his death as suicide but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning in following an internet campaign british prime minister gordon brown made an official public apology on behalf of the british government for the appalling way he was treated queen elizabeth ii granted him posthumous pardon in the alan turing law is now an informal term for law in the united kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts early life and education family turing was born in maida vale london while his father julius mathison turing was on leave from his position with the indian civil service ics at chhatrapur bihar and orissa province in british india turing father was the son of clergyman the rev john robert turing from scottish family of merchants that had been based in the netherlands and included baronet turing mother julius wife was ethel sara turing née stoney daughter of edward waller stoney chief engineer of the madras railways the stoneys were protestant anglo irish gentry family from both county tipperary and county longford while ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in county clare julius work with the ics brought the family to british india where his grandfather had been general in the bengal army however both julius and ethel wanted their children to be brought up in britain so they moved to maida vale london where alan turing was born on june as recorded by blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth later the colonnade hotel turing had an elder brother john the father of sir john dermot turing th baronet of the turing baronets turing father civil service commission was still active and during turing childhood years turing parents travelled between hastings in england and india leaving their two sons to stay with retired army couple at hastings turing stayed at baston lodge upper maze hill st leonards on sea now marked with blue plaque the plaque was unveiled on june the centenary of turing birth very early in life turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently his parents purchased house in guildford in and turing lived there during school holidays the location is also marked with blue plaque school turing parents enrolled him at st michael day school at charles road st leonards on sea at the age of six the headmistress recognised his talent early on as did many of his subsequent teachers between january and turing was educated at hazelhurst preparatory school an independent school in the village of frant in sussex now east sussex in at the age of he went on to sherborne school boarding independent school in the market town of sherborne in dorset the first day of term coincided with the general strike in britain but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied from southampton to sherborne stopping overnight at an inn turing natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at sherborne whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics his headmaster wrote to his parents hope he will not fall between two stools if he is to stay at public school he must aim at becoming educated if he is to be solely scientific specialist he is wasting his time at public school despite this turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved solving advanced problems in without having studied even elementary calculus in aged turing encountered albert einstein work not only did he grasp it but it is possible that he managed to deduce einstein questioning of newton laws of motion from text in which this was never made explicit christopher morcom at sherborne turing formed significant friendship with fellow pupil christopher morcom who has been described as turing first love their relationship provided inspiration in turing future endeavours but it was cut short by morcom death in february from complications of bovine tuberculosis contracted after drinking infected cow milk some years previously the event caused turing great sorrow he coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with morcom in letter to morcom mother turing said am sure could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited regarded my interest in my work and in such things as astronomy to which he introduced me as something to be shared with him and think he felt little the same about me know must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive because that is what he would like me to do some have speculated that morcom death was the cause of turing atheism and materialism apparently at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as spirit independent of the body and surviving death in later letter also written to morcom mother turing said personally believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body as regards the actual connection between spirit and body consider that the body can hold on to spirit whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected when the body is asleep cannot guess what happens but when the body dies the mechanism of the body holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds new body sooner or later perhaps immediately university and work on computability after sherborne turing studied as an undergraduate from to at king college cambridge where he was awarded first class honours in mathematics in at the age of he was elected fellow of king on the strength of dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem unknown to the committee the theorem had already been proven in by jarl waldemar lindeberg in turing published his paper on computable numbers with an application to the in this paper turing reformulated kurt gödel results on the limits of proof and computation replacing gödel universal arithmetic based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as turing machines the decision problem was originally posed by german mathematician david hilbert in turing proved that his universal computing machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm he went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for turing machines is undecidable it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether turing machine will ever halt king college cambridge where turing was student in and became fellow in the computer room is named after him although turing proof was published shortly after alonzo church equivalent proof using his lambda calculus turing approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than church it also included notion of universal machine now known as universal turing machine with the idea that such machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine as indeed could church lambda calculus according to the church turing thesis turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable john von neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to turing paper to this day turing machines are central object of study in theory of computation from september to july turing spent most of his time studying under church at princeton university in the second year as jane eliza procter visiting fellow in addition to his purely mathematical work he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro mechanical binary multiplier in june he obtained his phd from princeton his dissertation systems of logic based on ordinals introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing where turing machines are augmented with so called oracles allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by turing machines john von neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant but he went back to england career and research when turing returned to cambridge he attended lectures given in by ludwig wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim including interjections from turing and other students from students notes turing and wittgenstein argued and disagreed with turing defending formalism and wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them cryptanalysis during the second world war turing was leading participant in the breaking of german ciphers at bletchley park the historian and wartime codebreaker asa briggs has said you needed exceptional talent you needed genius at bletchley and turing was that genius from september turing had been working part time with the gc cs the british codebreaking organisation he concentrated on cryptanalysis of the enigma with dilly knox senior gc cs codebreaker soon after the july warsaw meeting at which the polish cipher bureau had provided the british and french with the details of the wiring of enigma rotors and their method of decrypting enigma code messages turing and knox started to work on less fragile approach to the problem the polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the germans were likely to change which they did in may turing approach was more general using crib based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe an improvement of the polish bomba two cottages in the stable yard at bletchley park turing worked here in and before moving to hut on september the day after the uk declared war on germany turing reported to bletchley park the wartime station of gc cs specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that turing made during the war the others were deducing the indicator procedure used by the german navy developing statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed banburismus developing procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the lorenz sz tunny dubbed turingery and towards the end of the war the development of portable secure voice scrambler at hanslope park that was codenamed delilah by using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process turing made an innovative contribution to the subject he wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches titled the applications of probability to cryptography and paper on statistics of repetitions which were of such value to gc cs and its successor gchq that they were not released to the uk national archives until april shortly before the centenary of his birth gchq mathematician who identified himself only as richard said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some years demonstrated their importance and their relevance to post war cryptanalysis turing had something of reputation for eccentricity at bletchley park he was known to his colleagues as prof and his treatise on enigma was known as the prof book jack good cryptanalyst who worked with him is quoted by ronald lewin as having said of turing while working at bletchley turing who was talented long distance runner occasionally ran the to london when he was needed for high level meetings and he was capable of world class marathon standards turing tried out for the british olympic team hampered by an injury his tryout time for the marathon was only minutes slower than british silver medallist thomas richards olympic race time of hours minutes he was walton athletic club best runner fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone in turing was appointed an officer of the order of the british empire obe by king george vi for his wartime services but his work remained secret for many years bombe within weeks of arriving at bletchley park turing had specified an machine that could help break enigma more effectively than the polish bomba kryptologiczna from which its name was derived the bombe with an enhancement suggested by mathematician gordon welchman became one of the primary tools and the major automated one used to attack enigma enciphered messages jack good opined complete and working replica of bombe at the national codes centre at bletchley parkthe bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an enigma message rotor order rotor settings and plugboard settings using suitable crib fragment of probable plaintext for each possible setting of the rotors which had on the order of states or states for the four rotor boat variant the bombe performed chain of logical deductions based on the crib implemented the bombe detected when contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting moving on to the next most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded leaving only few to be investigated in detail contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter this simply wasn possible with the enigma the first bombe was installed on march by late turing and his fellow cryptanalysts gordon welchman hugh alexander and stuart milner barry were frustrated building on the work of the poles they had set up good working system for decrypting enigma signals but they only had few people and few bombes so they did not have time to translate all the signals in the summer they had had considerable success and shipping losses had fallen to under tons month but they were still on knife edge they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of german adjustments they had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels but they were getting nowhere finally breaking all the rules on october they wrote directly to winston churchill spelling out their difficulties with turing as the first named they emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces as andrew hodges biographer of turing later wrote this letter had an electric effect churchill wrote memo to general ismay which read action this day make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done on november the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken the cryptographers at bletchley park did not know of the prime minister response but as milner barry later recalled all that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth more than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war statue of turing by stephen kettle at bletchley park commissioned by sidney frank built from half million pieces of welsh slate hut and the naval enigma turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of german naval enigma because no one else was doing anything about it and could have it to myself in december turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services that same night he also conceived of the idea of banburismus sequential statistical technique what abraham wald later called sequential analysis to assist in breaking the naval enigma though was not sure that it would work in practice and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken for this he invented measure of weight of evidence that he called the ban banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the enigma rotors substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes turing travelled to the united states in november and worked with us navy cryptanalysts on the naval enigma and bombe construction in washington he also visited their computing machine laboratory in dayton ohio turing reaction to the american bombe design was far from enthusiastic during this trip he also assisted at bell labs with the development of secure speech devices he returned to bletchley park in march during his absence hugh alexander had officially assumed the position of head of hut although alexander had been de facto head for some time turing having little interest in the day to day running of the section turing then became general consultant for cryptanalysis at bletchley park alexander wrote this about turing contribution turingery in july turing devised technique termed turingery or jokingly turingismus for use against the lorenz cipher messages produced by the germans new geheimschreiber secret writer machine this was teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed tunny at bletchley park turingery was method of wheel breaking procedure for working out the cam settings of tunny wheels he also introduced the tunny team to tommy flowers who under the guidance of max newman went on to build the colossus computer the world first programmable digital electronic computer which replaced simpler prior machine the heath robinson and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages some have mistakenly said that turing was key figure in the design of the colossus computer turingery and the statistical approach of banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the lorenz cipher but he was not directly involved in the colossus development delilah following his work at bell labs in the us turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system and in the latter part of the war he moved to work for the secret service radio security service later hmgcc at hanslope park there he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer donald bayley together they undertook the design and construction of portable secure voice communications machine codenamed delilah it was intended for different applications lacking capability for use with long distance radio transmissions and in any case delilah was completed too late to be used during the war though the system worked fully with turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting recording of winston churchill speech delilah was not adopted for use turing also consulted with bell labs on the development of sigsaly secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war early computers and the turing test hampton between and turing lived in hampton london while he worked on the design of the ace automatic computing engine at the national physical laboratory npl he presented paper on february which was the first detailed design of stored program computer von neumann incomplete first draft of report on the edvac had predated turing paper but it was much less detailed and according to john womersley superintendent of the npl mathematics division it contains number of ideas which are dr turing own although ace was feasible design the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at bletchley park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned in late he returned to cambridge for sabbatical year during which he produced seminal work on intelligent machinery that was not published in his lifetime while he was at cambridge the pilot ace was being built in his absence it executed its first program on may and number of later computers around the world owe much to it including the english electric deuce and the american bendix the full version of turing ace was not built until after his death according to the memoirs of the german computer pioneer heinz billing from the max planck institute for physics published by genscher düsseldorf there was meeting between alan turing and konrad zuse it took place in göttingen in the interrogation had the form of colloquium participants were womersley turing porter from england and few german researchers like zuse walther and billing for more details see herbert bruderer konrad zuse und die schweiz in turing was appointed reader in the mathematics department at the victoria university of manchester in he became deputy director of the computing machine laboratory there working on software for one of the earliest stored program computers the manchester mark during this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics and in computing machinery and intelligence mind october turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence and proposed an experiment that became known as the turing test an attempt to define standard for machine to be called intelligent the idea was that computer could be said to think if human interrogator could not tell it apart through conversation from human being in the paper turing suggested that rather than building program to simulate the adult mind it would be better rather to produce simpler one to simulate child mind and then to subject it to course of education reversed form of the turing test is widely used on the internet the captcha test is intended to determine whether the user is human or computer in turing working with his former undergraduate colleague champernowne began writing chess program for computer that did not yet exist by the program was completed and dubbed the turochamp in he tried to implement it on ferranti mark but lacking enough power the computer was unable to execute the program instead turing played game in which he simulated the computer taking about half an hour per move the game was recorded the program lost to turing colleague alick glennie although it is said that it won game against champernowne wife his turing test was significant provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence which continues after more than half century he also invented the lu decomposition method in used today for solving matrix equations pattern formation and mathematical biology in when turing was years old he turned to mathematical biology finally publishing his masterpiece the chemical basis of morphogenesis in january he was interested in morphogenesis the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms among other things he wanted to understand fibonacci phyllotaxis the existence of fibonacci numbers in plant structures he suggested that system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space termed reaction diffusion system could account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis he used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions for example if catalyst is required for certain chemical reaction to take place and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst but also produced an inhibitor that slowed down the production of if and then diffused through the container at different rates then you could have some regions where dominated and some where did to calculate the extent of this turing would have needed powerful computer but these were not so freely available in so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand fortunately these calculations gave the right qualitative results and produced for example uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots the russian biochemist boris belousov had performed experiments with similar results but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics for modern view of living organisms and the second law see second law of thermodynamics living organisms unfortunately belousov was not aware of turing paper in the philosophical transactions of the royal society although published before the structure and role of dna was understood turing work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered seminal piece of work in mathematical biology one of the early applications of turing paper was the work by james murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats large and small further research in the area suggests that turing work can partially explain the growth of feathers hair follicles the branching pattern of lungs and even the left right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest in sheth et al found that in mice removal of hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb suggesting that hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of turing type mechanism later papers were not available until collected works of turing was published in chess algorithm alan turing is credited with designing the first computer chess program in turing first worked on the algorithm in the program did not run on computer turing ran the program by flipping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on chessboard according to garry kasparov turing program played recognizable game of chess personal life in turing proposed marriage to hut colleague joan clarke fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst but their engagement was short lived after admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée who was reportedly unfazed by the revelation turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage conviction for indecency in january turing then started relationship with arnold murray year old unemployed man turing had met murray just before christmas outside the regal cinema when walking down manchester oxford road and invited him to lunch on january turing house was burgled murray told turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his and turing reported the crime to the police during the investigation he acknowledged sexual relationship with murray homosexual acts were criminal offences in the united kingdom at that time and both men were charged with gross indecency under section of the criminal law amendment act initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on february during which turing solicitor reserved his defence did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor turing entered plea of guilty the case regina turing and murray was brought to trial on march turing was convicted and given choice between imprisonment and probation which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido he accepted the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol now known as or des synthetic oestrogen this treatment was continued for the course of one year the treatment rendered turing impotent and caused gynaecomastia fulfilling in the literal sense turing prediction that no doubt shall emerge from it all different man but quite who ve not found out murray was given conditional discharge turing conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the government communications headquarters gchq the british signals intelligence agency that had evolved from gc cs in though he kept his academic job he was denied entry into the united states after his conviction in but was free to visit other european countries turing was never accused of espionage but in common with all who had worked at bletchley park he was prevented by the official secrets act from discussing his war work death on june turing housekeeper found him dead he had died the previous day post mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning when his body was discovered an apple lay half eaten beside his bed and although the apple was not tested for cyanide it was speculated that this was the means by which fatal dose was consumed an inquest determined that he had committed suicide and he was cremated at woking crematorium on june turing ashes were scattered there just as his father had been andrew hodges and another biographer david leavitt have both suggested that turing was re enacting scene from the walt disney film snow white and the seven dwarfs his favourite fairy tale both noting that in leavitt words he took an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the wicked queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew philosophy professor jack copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner historical verdict he suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of turing death this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for electroplating gold onto spoons which uses potassium cyanide to dissolve the gold turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison turing also habitually ate an apple before bed and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half eaten in addition turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment which had been discontinued year previously with good humour

ashoka died bce was an indian emperor of the maurya dynasty who ruled almost all of the indian subcontinent from to bce he was the grandson of the founder of the maurya dynasty chandragupta maurya who had created one of the largest empires in ancient india and then according to jain sources renounced it all to become jain monk one of india greatest emperors ashoka expanded chandragupta empire and reigned over realm that stretched from present day afghanistan in the west to bangladesh in the east it covered the entire indian subcontinent except for parts of present day tamil nadu karnataka and kerala the empire capital was pataliputra in magadha present day patna with provincial capitals at taxila and ujjain in about bce ashoka waged destructive war against the state of kalinga modern odisha he conquered kalinga which none of his ancestors had done some scholars suggest he belonged to the jain tradition but it is generally accepted that he embraced buddhism legends state he converted after witnessing the mass deaths of the kalinga war which he himself had waged out of desire for conquest ashoka reflected on the war in kalinga which reportedly had resulted in more than deaths and deportations ending at around deaths ashoka converted to buddhism about bce he is remembered for the ashoka pillars and edicts for sending buddhist monks to sri lanka and central asia and for establishing monuments marking several significant sites in the life of gautama buddha beyond the edicts of ashoka biographical information about him relies on legends written centuries later such as the nd century ce ashokavadana narrative of ashoka part of the divyavadana and in the sri lankan text mahavamsa great chronicle the emblem of the modern republic of india is an adaptation of the lion capital of ashoka ashoka name means painless without sorrow in sanskrit the privativum and śoka pain distress in his edicts he is referred to as pali or the beloved of the gods and pali or he who regards everyone with affection his fondness for his name connection to the saraca asoca tree or ashoka tree is also referenced in the ashokavadana wells wrote of ashoka in his book the outline of history amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like the name of ashoka shines and shines almost alone star biography ashoka early life ashoka was born to the mauryan emperor bindusara and subhadrangī or dharmā he was the grandson of chandragupta maurya founder of the maurya dynasty broadly chandragupta was born in humble family abandoned raised as son by another family then with the training and counsel of chanakya of arthashastra fame ultimately built one of the largest empires in ancient india ashoka grandfather chandragupta renounced it all and became monk in the jain tradition according to roman historian appian chandragupta had made marital alliance with seleucus there is thus possibility that ashoka had seleucid greek grandmother an indian puranic source the pratisarga parva of the bhavishya purana also described the marriage of chandragupta with greek yavana princess daughter of seleucus the ancient buddhist hindu and jain texts provide varying biographical accounts the avadana texts mention that his mother was queen subhadrangī according to the ashokavadana she was the daughter of brahmin from the city of champa she gave him the name ashoka meaning one without sorrow the divyāvadāna tells similar story but gives the name of the queen as janapadakalyānī ashoka had several elder siblings all of whom were his half brothers from the other wives of his father bindusara ashoka was given royal military training rise to power the buddhist text divyavadana describes ashoka putting down revolt due to activities of wicked ministers this may have been an incident in bindusara times taranatha account states that chanakya bindusara chief advisor destroyed the nobles and kings of towns and made himself the master of all territory between the eastern and the western seas some historians consider this as an indication of bindusara conquest of the deccan while others consider it as suppression of revolt following this ashoka was stationed at ujain the capital of malwa as governor bindusara death in bce led to war over succession according to the divyavadana bindusara wanted his elder son susima to succeed him but ashoka was supported by his father ministers who found susima to be arrogant and disrespectful towards them minister named radhagupta seems to have played an important role in ashoka rise to the throne the ashokavadana recounts radhagupta offering of an old royal elephant to ashoka for him to ride to the garden of the gold pavilion where king bindusara would determine his successor ashoka later got rid of the legitimate heir to the throne by tricking him into entering pit filled with live coals radhagupta according to the ashokavadana would later be appointed prime minister by ashoka once he had gained the throne the dipavansa and mahavansa refer to ashoka killing of his brothers sparing only one named vitashoka or tissa although there is no clear proof about this incident many such accounts are saturated with mythological elements the coronation happened in bce four years after his succession to the throne deer park sanchi relief buddhist legends state that ashoka was bad tempered and of wicked nature he built ashoka hell an elaborate torture chamber described as paradisal hell due to the contrast between its beautiful exterior and the acts carried out within by his appointed executioner girikaa this earned him the name of chanda ashoka meaning ashoka the fierce in sanskrit professor charles drekmeier cautions that the buddhist legends tend to dramatise the change that buddhism brought in him and therefore exaggerate ashoka past wickedness and his piousness after the conversion ascending the throne ashoka expanded his empire over the next eight years from the present day assam in the east to balochistan in the west from the pamir knot in afghanistan in the north to the peninsula of southern india except for present day tamil nadu and kerala which were ruled by the three ancient tamil kingdoms conquest of kalinga while the early part of ashoka reign was apparently quite bloodthirsty he became follower of the buddha teachings after his conquest of kalinga on the east coast of india in the present day states of odisha and north coastal andhra pradesh kalinga was state that prided itself on its sovereignty and democracy with its monarchical parliamentary democracy it was quite an exception in ancient bharata where there existed the concept of rajdharma rajdharma means the duty of the rulers which was intrinsically entwined with the concept of bravery and dharma the kalinga war happened eight years after his coronation from his th inscription we come to know that the battle was massive one and caused the deaths of more than soldiers and many civilians who rose up in defence over were deported when he was walking through the grounds of kalinga after his conquest rejoicing in his victory he was moved by the number of bodies strewn there and the wails of the bereaved marriage from the various sources that speak of his life ashoka is believed to have had five wives they were named devi or vedisa mahadevi shakyakumari the second queen karuvaki asandhimitra designated or chief queen padmavati and tishyarakshita he is similarly believed to have had four sons and two daughters son by devi named mahendra pali mahinda tivara son of karuvaki kunala son of padmavati and jalauka mentioned in the kashmir chronicle daughter of devi named sanghamitra pali sanghamitta and another daughter named charumati according to one version of the mahavamsa the buddhist chronicle of sri lanka ashoka when he was heir apparent and was journeying as viceroy to ujjain is said to have halted at vidisha kilometers from sanchi and there married the daughter of local banker she was called devi and later gave ashoka two sons ujjeniya and mahendra and daughter sanghamitta after ashoka accession mahendra headed buddhist mission sent probably under the auspices of the emperor to sri lanka buddhist conversion the diamond throne built by ashoka at the mahabodhi temple in bodh gaya at the location where the buddha reached enlightenment edict on the edicts of ashoka rock inscriptions reflect the great remorse the king felt after observing the destruction of kalinga his majesty felt remorse on account of the conquest of kalinga because during the subjugation of previously unconquered country slaughter death and taking away captive of the people necessarily occur whereas his majesty feels profound sorrow and regret the edict goes on to address the even greater degree of sorrow and regret resulting from ashoka understanding that the friends and families of deceased would suffer greatly too legend says that one day after the war was over ashoka ventured out to roam the city and all he could see were burnt houses and scattered corpses the lethal war with kalinga transformed the vengeful emperor ashoka to stable and peaceful emperor and he became patron of buddhism according to the prominent indologist basham ashoka personal religion became buddhism if not before then certainly after the kalinga war however according to basham the dharma officially propagated by ashoka was not buddhism at all nevertheless his patronage led to the expansion of buddhism in the mauryan empire and other kingdoms during his rule and worldwide from about bce prominent in this cause were his son mahinda mahendra and daughter sanghamitra whose name means friend of the sangha who established buddhism in ceylon now sri lanka vaishali death and legacy ashoka major rock edict at junagadh contains inscriptions by ashoka fourteen of the edicts of ashoka rudradaman and skandagupta ashoka ruled for an estimated years and died in bce legend states that during his cremation his body burned for seven days and nights after his death the mauryan dynasty lasted just fifty more years until his empire stretched over almost all of the indian subcontinent ashoka had many wives and children but many of their names are lost to time his chief consort agramahisi for the majority of his reign was his wife asandhimitra who apparently bore him no children in his old age he seems to have come under the spell of his youngest wife tishyaraksha it is said that she had got ashoka son kunala the regent in takshashila and the heir presumptive to the throne blinded by wily stratagem the official executioners spared kunala and he became wandering singer accompanied by his favourite wife kanchanmala in pataliputra ashoka heard kunala song and realised that kunala misfortune may have been punishment for some past sin of the emperor himself he condemned tishyaraksha to death restoring kunala to the court in the ashokavadana kunala is portrayed as forgiving tishyaraksha having obtained enlightenment through buddhist practice while he urges ashoka to forgive her as well ashoka does not respond with the same forgiveness kunala was succeeded by his son samprati who ruled for years until his death the reign of ashoka maurya might have disappeared into history as the ages passed by had he not left behind records of his reign these records are in the form of sculpted pillars and rocks inscribed with variety of actions and teachings he wished to be published under his name the language used for inscription was in one of the prakrit common languages etched in brahmi script in the year bce about fifty years after ashoka death the last maurya ruler brihadratha was assassinated by the commander in chief of the mauryan armed forces pushyamitra shunga while he was taking the guard of honor of his forces pushyamitra shunga founded the shunga dynasty bce and ruled just fragmented part of the mauryan empire many of the northwestern territories of the mauryan empire modern day afghanistan and northern pakistan became the indo greek kingdom king ashoka the third monarch of the indian mauryan dynasty is also considered as one of the most exemplary rulers who ever lived buddhist kingship the khalsi rock edict of ashoka which mentions the greek kings antiochus ptolemy antigonus magas and alexander by name as recipients of his teachings one of the more enduring legacies of ashoka was the model that he provided for the relationship between buddhism and the state emperor ashoka was seen as role model to leaders within the buddhist community he not only provided guidance and strength but he also created personal relationships with his supporters throughout theravada southeastern asia the model of rulership embodied by ashoka replaced the notion of divine kingship that had previously dominated in the angkor kingdom for instance under this model of buddhist kingship the king sought to legitimise his rule not through descent from divine source but by supporting and earning the approval of the buddhist sangha following ashoka example kings established monasteries funded the construction of stupas and supported the ordination of monks in their kingdom many rulers also took an active role in resolving disputes over the status and regulation of the sangha as ashoka had in calling conclave to settle number of contentious issues during his reign this development ultimately led to close association in many southeast asian countries between the monarchy and the religious hierarchy an association that can still be seen today in the state supported buddhism of thailand and the traditional role of the thai king as both religious and secular leader ashoka also said that all his courtiers always governed the people in moral manner according to the legends mentioned in the nd century ce text ashokavadana ashoka was not non violent after adopting buddhism in one instance non buddhist in pundravardhana drew picture showing the buddha bowing at the feet of nirgrantha jnatiputra identified with mahavira th tirthankara of jainism on complaint from buddhist devotee ashoka issued an order to arrest him and subsequently another order to kill all the ajivikas in pundravardhana around followers of the ajivika sect were executed as result of this order sometime later another nirgrantha follower in pataliputra drew similar picture ashoka burnt him and his entire family alive in their house he also announced an award of one dinara silver coin to anyone who brought him the head of nirgrantha heretic according to ashokavadana as result of this order his own brother was mistaken for heretic and killed by cowherd however for several reasons scholars say these stories of persecutions of rival sects by ashoka appear to be clear fabrications arising out of sectarian propaganda historical sources ashoka was almost forgotten by the historians of the early british india but james prinsep contributed in the revelation of historical sources another important historian was british archaeologist john hubert marshall who was director general of the archaeological survey of india his main interests were sanchi and sarnath in addition to harappa and mohenjodaro sir alexander cunningham british archaeologist and army engineer and often known as the father of the archaeological survey of india unveiled heritage sites like the bharhut stupa sarnath sanchi and the mahabodhi temple mortimer wheeler british archaeologist also exposed ashokan historical sources especially the taxila the kandahar edict of ashoka bilingual inscription in greek and aramaic by king ashoka discovered at kandahar information about the life and reign of ashoka primarily comes from relatively small number of buddhist sources in particular the sanskrit ashokavadana story of ashoka written in the nd century and the two pāli chronicles of sri lanka the dipavamsa and mahavamsa provide most of the currently known information about ashoka additional information is contributed by the edicts of ashoka whose authorship was finally attributed to the ashoka of buddhist legend after the discovery of dynastic lists that gave the name used in the edicts priyadarshi he who regards everyone with affection as title or additional name of ashoka maurya architectural remains of his period have been found at kumhrar patna which include an pillar hypostyle hall edicts of ashoka the edicts of ashoka are collection of inscriptions on the pillars of ashoka as well as boulders and cave walls made by ashoka during his reign these inscriptions are dispersed throughout modern day pakistan and india and represent the first tangible evidence of buddhism the edicts describe in detail the first wide expansion of buddhism through the sponsorship of one of the most powerful kings of indian history offering more information about ashoka proselytism moral precepts religious precepts and his notions of social and animal welfare ashokavadana the aśokāvadāna is nd century ce text related to the legend of ashoka the legend was translated into chinese by fa hien in ce it is essentially hinayana text and its world is that of mathura and north west india the emphasis of this little known text is on exploring the relationship between the king and the community of monks the sangha and setting up an ideal of religious life for the laity the common man by telling appealing stories about religious exploits the most startling feature is that ashoka conversion has nothing to do with the kalinga war which is not even mentioned nor is there word about his belonging to the maurya dynasty equally surprising is the record of his use of state power to spread buddhism in an uncompromising fashion the legend of veetashoka provides insights into ashoka

mudra this symbol was not used on the pre mauryan punch marked coins but only on coins of the maurya period together with the three arched hill symbol the peacock on the hill the triskelis and the taxila mark perceptions and historiography the use of buddhist sources in reconstructing the life of ashoka has had strong influence on perceptions of ashoka as well as the interpretations of his edicts building on traditional accounts early scholars regarded ashoka as primarily buddhist monarch who underwent conversion to buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the buddhist monastic institution some scholars have tended to question this assessment romila thappar writes about ashoka that we need to see him both as statesman in the context of inheriting and sustaining an empire in particular historical period and as person with strong commitment to changing society through what might be called the propagation of social ethics the only source of information not attributable to buddhist sources are the ashokan edicts and these do not explicitly state that ashoka was buddhist in his edicts ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of his time buddhism brahmanism jainism and ajivikaism and his edicts addressed to the population at large there are some addressed specifically to buddhists this is not the case for the other religions generally focus on moral themes members of all the religions would accept for example amartya sen writes the indian emperor ashoka in the third century bce presented many political inscriptions in favor of tolerance and individual freedom both as part of state policy and in the relation of different people to each other however the edicts alone strongly that he was buddhist in one edict he belittles rituals and he banned vedic animal sacrifices these strongly suggest that he at least did not look to the vedic tradition for guidance furthermore many edicts are expressed to buddhists alone in one ashoka declares himself to be an upasaka and in another he demonstrates close familiarity with buddhist texts he erected rock pillars at buddhist holy sites but did not do so for the sites of other religions he also used the word dhamma to refer to qualities of the heart that underlie moral action this was an exclusively buddhist use of the word however he used the word more in the spirit than as strict code of conduct romila thappar writes his dhamma did not derive from divine inspiration even if its observance promised heaven it was more in keeping with the ethic conditioned by the logic of given situations his logic of dhamma was intended to influence the conduct of categories of people in relation to each other especially where they involved unequal relationships finally he promotes ideals that correspond to the first three steps of the buddha graduated discourse interestingly the ashokavadana presents an alternate view of the familiar ashoka one in which his conversion has nothing to do with the kalinga war or about his descent from the maurya dynasty instead ashoka reason for adopting non violence appears much more personal the ashokavadana shows that the main source of ashoka conversion and the acts of welfare that followed are rooted instead in intense personal anguish at its core from wellspring inside himself rather than spurred by specific event it thereby illuminates ashoka as more humanly ambitious and passionate with both greatness and flaws this ashoka is very different from the shadowy do gooder of later pali chronicles much of the knowledge about ashoka comes from the several inscriptions that he had carved on pillars and rocks throughout the empire all his inscriptions present him as compassionate and loving in the kalinga rock edits he addresses his people as his children and mentions that as father he desires their good these inscriptions promoted buddhist morality and encouraged nonviolence and adherence to dharma duty or proper behaviour and they talk of his fame and conquered lands as well as the neighbouring kingdoms holding up his might one also gets some primary information about the kalinga war and ashoka allies plus some useful knowledge on the civil administration the ashoka pillar at sarnath is the most notable of the relics left by ashoka made of sandstone this pillar records the visit of the emperor to sarnath in the rd century bce it has four lion capital four lions standing back to back which was adopted as the emblem of the modern indian republic the lion symbolises both ashoka imperial rule and the kingship of the buddha in translating these monuments historians learn the bulk of what is assumed to have been true fact of the mauryan empire it is difficult to determine whether or not some events ever actually happened but the stone etchings clearly depict how ashoka wanted to be thought of and remembered focus of debate front frieze of the diamond throne built by ashoka at bodh gaya recently scholarly analysis determined that the three major foci of debate regarding ashoka involve the nature of the maurya empire the extent and impact of ashoka pacifism and what is referred to in the inscriptions as dhamma or dharma which connotes goodness virtue and charity some historians have argued that ashoka pacifism undermined the military backbone of the maurya empire while others have suggested that the extent and impact of his pacifism have been grossly exaggerated the dhamma of the edicts has been understood as concurrently buddhist lay ethic set of politico moral ideas sort of universal religion or as an ashokan innovation on the other hand it has also been interpreted as an essentially political ideology that sought to knit together vast and diverse empire scholars are still attempting to analyse both the expressed and implied political ideas of the edicts particularly in regard to imperial vision and make inferences pertaining to how that vision was grappling with problems and political realities of virtually subcontinental and culturally and economically highly variegated rd century bce indian empire nonetheless it remains clear that ashoka inscriptions represent the earliest corpus of royal inscriptions in the indian subcontinent and therefore prove to be very important innovation in royal practices legends of ashoka ashoka and his two queens in relief at sanchi until the ashokan inscriptions were discovered and deciphered stories about ashoka were based on the legendary accounts of his life and not strictly on historical facts these legends were found in buddhist textual sources such as the text of ashokavadana the ashokavadana is subset of larger set of legends in the divyavadana though it could have existed independently as well following are some of the legends narrated in the ashokavadana about ashoka one of the stories talks about an event that occurred in past life of ashoka when he was small child named jaya once when jaya was playing on the roadside the buddha came by the young child put handful of earth in the buddha begging bowl as his gift to the saint and declared his wish to one day become great emperor and follower of the buddha the buddha is said to have smiled smile that illuminated the universe with its rays of light these rays of light are then said to have re entered the buddha left palm signifying that this child jaya would in his next life become great emperor the buddha is said to have even turned to his disciple ananda and is said to have predicted that this child would be great righteous chakravarti king who would rule his empire from his capital at pataliputra another story aims to portray ashoka as an evil person in order to convey the importance of his transformation into good person upon adopting buddhism it begins by stating that due to ashoka physical ugliness he was disliked by his father bindusara ashoka wanted to become king and so he got rid of the heir by tricking him into entering pit filled with live coals he became famous as ashoka the fierce because of his wicked nature and bad temper he is said to have subjected his ministers to test of loyalty and then have of them killed for failing it he is said to have burnt his entire harem to death when certain women insulted him he is supposed to have derived sadistic pleasure from watching other people suffer and for this he built himself an elaborate and horrific torture chamber where he amused himself by torturing other people the story then goes on to narrate how it was only after an encounter with pious buddhist monk that ashoka himself transformed into ashoka the pious chinese traveler who visited india in the th century ce xuanzang recorded in his memoirs that he visited the place where the supposed torture chamber stood another story is about events that occurred towards the end of ashoka time on earth ashoka is said to have started gifting away the contents of his treasury to the buddhist sangha his ministers however were scared that his eccentricity would be the downfall of the empire and so denied him access to the treasury as result ashoka started giving away his personal possessions and was eventually left with nothing and so died peacefully at this point it is important to note that the ashokavadana being buddhist text in itself sought to gain new converts for buddhism and so used all these legends devotion to the buddha and loyalty to the sangha are stressed such texts added to the perception that ashoka was essentially the ideal buddhist monarch who deserved both admiration and emulation ashoka and the relics of the buddha according to buddhist legend particularly the mahaparinirvana the relics of the buddha had been shared among eight countries following his death ashoka endeavoured to take back the relics and share them among stupas this story is amply depicted in the reliefs of sanchi and bharhut according to the legend ashoka obtained the ashes from seven of the countries but failed to take the ashes from the nagas at ramagrama this scene is depicted on the tranversal portion of the southern gateway at sanchi nagas but in vain southern gateway stupa sanchi contributions approach towards religions according to indian historian romila thapar ashoka emphasized respect for all religious teachers and harmonious relationship between parents and children teachers and pupils and employers and employees ashoka religion contained gleanings from all religions he emphasized the virtues of ahimsa respect to all religious teachers equal respect for and study of each other scriptures and rational faith global spread of buddhism stupa of sanchi the central stupa was built during the mauryas and enlarged during the sungas but the decorative gateway is dated to the later dynasty of the satavahanas as buddhist emperor ashoka believed that buddhism is beneficial for all human beings as well as animals and plants so he built number of stupas sangharama viharas chaitya and residences for buddhist monks all over south asia and central asia according to the ashokavadana he ordered the construction of stupas to house the buddha relics in the ashoka takes offerings to each of these stupas traveling in chariot adorned with precious metals he gave donations to viharas and mathas he sent his only daughter sanghamitra and son mahindra to spread buddhism in sri lanka then known as tamraparni according to the mahavamsa in the th year of ashoka reign at the end of the third buddhist council ashoka sent buddhist missionaries to nine parts of the world to propagate buddhism geographical distribution of known capitals of the pillars of ashoka these are all thought to have been commissioned by ashoka ashoka also invited buddhists and non buddhists for religious conferences he inspired the buddhist monks to compose the sacred religious texts and also gave all types of help to that end ashoka also helped to develop viharas intellectual hubs such as nalanda and taxila ashoka helped to construct sanchi and mahabodhi temple ashoka also gave donations to non buddhists as his reign continued his even handedness was replaced with special inclination towards buddhism ashoka helped and respected both shramanas buddhists monks and brahmins vedic monks ashoka also helped to organise the third buddhist council at pataliputra today patna it was conducted by the monk moggaliputta tissa who was the spiritual teacher of ashoka emperor ashoka son mahinda also helped with the spread of buddhism by translating the buddhist canon into language that could be understood by the people of sri lanka it is well known that ashoka sent dütas or emissaries to convey messages or letters written or oral rather both to various people the vith rock edict about oral orders reveals this it was later confirmed that it was not unusual to add oral messages to written ones and the content of ashoka messages can be inferred likewise from the xiiith rock edict they were meant to spread his dhammavijaya which he considered the highest victory and which he wished to propagate everywhere including far beyond india there is obvious and undeniable trace of cultural contact through the adoption of the kharosthi script and the idea of installing inscriptions might have travelled with this script as achaemenid influence is seen in some of the formulations used by ashoka in his inscriptions this indicates to us that ashoka was indeed in contact with other cultures and was an active part in mingling and spreading new cultural ideas beyond his own immediate walls hellenistic world distribution of the edicts of ashoka and location of the contemporary greek city of ai khanoum buddhist proselytism at the time of king ashoka bce in his edicts ashoka mentions some of the people living in hellenic countries as converts to buddhism and recipients of his envoys although no hellenic historical record of this event remains it is not too far fetched to imagine however that ashoka received letters from greek rulers and was acquainted with the hellenistic royal orders in the same way as he perhaps knew of the inscriptions of the achaemenid kings given the presence of ambassadors of hellenistic kings in india as well as the dütas sent by ashoka himself dionysius is reported to have been such greek ambassador at the court of ashoka sent by ptolemy ii philadelphus who himself is mentioned in the edicts of ashoka as recipient of the buddhist proselytism of ashoka some hellenistic philosophers such as hegesias of cyrene who probably lived under the rule of king magas one of the supposed recipients of buddhist emissaries from asoka are sometimes thought to have been influenced by buddhist teachings the greeks in india even seem to have played an active role in the propagation of buddhism as some of the emissaries of ashoka such as dharmaraksita are described in pali sources as leading greek yona buddhist monks active in spreading buddhism the mahavamsa xii some greeks yavana may have played an administrative role in the territories ruled by ashoka the girnar inscription of rudradaman records that during the rule of ashoka yavana governor was in charge in the area of girnar gujarat mentioning his role in the construction of water reservoir as administrator mauryan ringstone with standing goddess northwest pakistan rd century bce british museum ashoka military power was strong but after his conversion to buddhism he maintained friendly relations with three major tamil kingdoms in the south namely cheras cholas and pandyas the post alexandrian empire tamraparni and suvarnabhumi his edicts state that he made provisions for medical treatment of humans and animals in his own kingdom as well as in these neighbouring states he also had wells dug and trees planted along the roads for the benefit of the common people animal welfare ashoka rock edicts declare that injuring living things is not good and no animal should be sacrificed for slaughter however he did not prohibit common cattle slaughter or beef eating he imposed ban on killing of all four footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible and of specific animal species including several birds certain types of fish and bulls among others he also banned killing of female goats sheep and pigs that were nursing their young as well as their young up to the age of six months he also banned killing of all fish and castration of animals during certain periods such as chaturmasa and uposatha ashoka also abolished the royal hunting of animals and restricted the slaying of animals for food in the royal residence because he banned hunting created many veterinary clinics and eliminated meat eating on many holidays the mauryan empire under ashoka has been described as one of the very few instances in world history of government treating its animals as citizens who are as deserving of its protection as the human residents ashoka chakra the ashoka chakra the wheel of righteousness dharma in sanskrit or dhamma in pali the ashoka chakra the wheel of ashoka is depiction of the dharmachakra the wheel of dharma the wheel has spokes which represent the laws of dependent origination and the laws of dependent termination the ashoka chakra has been widely inscribed on many

the republic of india adopted on july where it is rendered in navy blue color on white background by replacing the symbol of charkha spinning wheel of the pre independence versions of the flag the

selected stone architecture the pataliputra capital rd century bce capital from the mauryan palace in pataliputra displaying hellenistic designs rampurva bull capital detail of the abacus with two flame palmettes framing lotus surrounded by small rosette flowers ashoka is often credited with the beginning of stone architecture in india possibly following the introduction of stone building techniques by the greeks after alexander the great before ashoka time buildings were probably built in non permanent material such as wood bamboo or thatch ashoka may have rebuilt his palace in pataliputra by replacing wooden material by stone and may also have used the help of foreign craftmen ashoka also innovated by using the permament qualities of stone for his written edicts as well as his pillars with buddhist symbolism pillars of ashoka ashokstambha the ashokan pillar at lumbini nepal buddha birthplace the pillars of ashoka are series of columns dispersed throughout the northern indian subcontinent and erected by ashoka during his reign in the rd century bce originally there must have been many pillars of ashoka although only ten with inscriptions still survive averaging between forty and fifty feet in height and weighing up to fifty tons each all the pillars were quarried at chunar just south of varanasi and dragged sometimes hundreds of miles to where they were erected the first pillar of ashoka was found in the th century by thomas coryat in the ruins of ancient delhi the wheel represents the sun time and buddhist law while the swastika stands for the cosmic dance around fixed center and guards against evil lion capital of ashoka ashokmudra ashoka pillar capital of sarnath ashokan capitals were highly realistic and used characteristic polished finish giving shiny appearance to the stone surface this sculpture has been adopted as the national emblem of india rd century bce the lion capital of ashoka is sculpture of four lions standing back

capital is now in the sarnath museum this lion capital of ashoka from sarnath has been adopted as the national emblem of india and the wheel ashoka chakra from its base was placed onto the center of the national flag of india the capital contains four lions indian asiatic lions standing back to back mounted on short cylindrical abacus with frieze carrying sculptures in high relief of an elephant galloping horse bull and lion separated by intervening spoked chariot wheels over bell shaped lotus carved out of single block of polished sandstone the capital was believed to be crowned by wheel of dharma dharmachakra popularly known in india as the ashoka chakra the sarnath pillar bears one of the edicts of ashoka an inscription against division within the buddhist community which reads no one shall cause division in the order of monks the four animals in the sarnath capital are believed to symbolise different steps of lord buddha life the elephant represents the buddha idea in reference to the dream of queen maya of white elephant entering her womb the bull represents desire during the life of the buddha as prince the horse represents buddha departure from palatial life the lion represents the accomplishment of buddha besides the religious interpretations there are some non religious interpretations also about the symbolism of the ashoka capital pillar at sarnath according to them the four lions symbolise ashoka rule over the four directions the wheels as symbols of his enlightened rule chakravartin and the four animals as symbols of four adjoining territories of india

in christianity arianism is christological concept which asserts the belief that jesus christ is the son of god who was begotten by god the father at point in time is distinct from the father and is therefore subordinate to the father arian teachings were first attributed to arius ad christian presbyter in alexandria egypt the teachings of arius and his supporters were opposed to the theological views held by homoousian christians regarding the nature of the trinity and the nature of christ the arian concept of christ is based on the belief that the son of god did not always exist but was begotten by god the father there was dispute between two interpretations arianism and homoousianism based upon the theological orthodoxy of the time and both of them attempted to solve its theological dilemmas so there were initially two equally orthodox interpretations which initiated conflict in order to attract adepts and define the new orthodoxy homoousianism was formally affirmed by the first two ecumenical councils the ecumenical first council of nicaea of deemed arianism to be heresy all mainstream branches of christianity now consider arianism to be heterodox and heretical according to everett ferguson the great majority of christians had no clear views about the nature of the trinity and they did not understand what was at stake in the issues that surrounded it at the regional first synod of tyre in arius was exonerated constantine the great was baptized by the arian bishop eusebius of nicomedia after the deaths of both arius and constantine arius was again anathemised and pronounced heretic again at the ecumenical first council of constantinople of the roman emperors constantius ii and valens were arians or semi arians as was the first king of italy odoacer and the lombards were also arians or semi arians until the th century arianism is also used to refer to other nontrinitarian theological systems of the th century which regarded jesus christ the son of god the logos as either begotten being as in arianism proper and anomoeanism or as neither uncreated nor created in the sense other beings are created as in semi arianism origin arius had been pupil of lucian of antioch at lucian private academy in antioch and inherited from him modified form of the teachings of paul of samosata he taught that god the father and the son of god did not always exist together eternally arians taught that the logos was divine being begotten by god the father before the creation of the world made him medium through whom everything else was created and that the son of god is subordinate to god the father verse from proverbs was also used the lord created me at the beginning of his work proverbs therefore the son was rather the very first and the most perfect of god creatures and he was made god only by the father permission and power controversy over arianism arose in the late rd century and persisted throughout most of the th century it involved most church members from simple believers priests and monks to bishops emperors and members of rome imperial family two roman emperors constantius ii and valens became arians or semi arians as did prominent gothic vandal and lombard warlords both before and after the fall of the western roman empire such deep controversy within the church during this period of its development could not have materialized without significant historical influences providing basis for the arian doctrines of the roughly three hundred bishops in attendance at the council of nicea two bishops did not sign the nicene creed that condemned arianism emperor constantine also ordered penalty of death for those who refused to surrender the arian writings beliefs reconstructing what arius actually taught and why is formidable task both because little of his own work survives except in quotations selected for polemical purposes by his opponents and also because there is no certainty about what theological and philosophical traditions formed his thought arians do not believe in the traditional doctrine of the trinity the letter of arian auxentius regarding the arian missionary ulfilas gives picture of arian beliefs arian ulfilas who was ordained bishop by arian eusebius of nicomedia and returned to his people to work as missionary believed god the father unbegotten god almighty god always existing and who is the only true god john the son of god jesus christ only begotten god john mighty god isaiah begotten before time began proverbs revelation colossians and who is lord master cor the holy spirit the illuminating and sanctifying power who is neither god the father nor lord master first corinthians was cited as proof text the creed of arian ulfilas which concludes letter praising him written by auxentius distinguishes god the father unbegotten who is the only true god from son of god only begotten who is lord master and the holy spirit the illuminating and sanctifying power who is neither god the father nor lord master letter from arius to the arian eusebius of nicomedia died succinctly states the core beliefs of the arians according to bart ehrman the dispute between trinitarianism and arianism was about has the son always existed next to the father or was the son begotten at certain time in eternity past is the son equal to the father or subordinated to the father for constantine it was minor theological claptrap that stood in the way of uniting the empire but for the theologians it was of huge importance homoian arianism arianism had several different variants including eunomianism and homoian arianism homoian arianism is associated with akakius and eudoxius homoian arianism avoided the use of the word ousia to describe the relation of father to son and described these as like each other hanson lists twelve creeds that reflect the homoian faith the second sirmian creed of the creed of nice constantinople the creed put forward by akakius at seleucia the rule of faith of ulfilas the creed uttered by ulfilas on his deathbed the creed attributed to eudoxius the creed of auxentius of milan the creed of germinius professed in correspondence with valens and ursacius palladius rule of faith three credal statements found in fragments subordinating the son to the father struggles with orthodoxy first council of nicaea constantine burning arian books illustration from compendium of canon law in arius was denounced by synod at alexandria for teaching heterodox view of the relationship of jesus to god the father because arius and his followers had great influence in the schools of alexandria counterparts to modern universities or seminaries their theological views spread especially in the eastern mediterranean by the controversy had become significant enough that the emperor constantine called an assembly of bishops the first council of nicaea which condemned arius doctrine and formulated the original nicene creed of the nicene creed central term used to describe the relationship between the father and the son is homoousios or meaning of the same substance or of one being the athanasian creed is less often used but is more overtly anti arian statement on the trinity the focus of the council of nicaea was the nature of the son of god and his precise relationship to god the father see paul of samosata and the synods of antioch arius taught that jesus christ was divine holy and was sent to earth for the salvation of mankind but that jesus christ was not equal to god the father infinite primordial origin in rank and that god the father and the son of god were not equal to the holy spirit power of god the father under arianism christ was instead not consubstantial with god the father since both the father and the son under arius were made of like essence or being see homoiousia but not of the same essence or being see homoousia in the arian view god the father is deity and is divine and the son of god is not deity but divine the lord am deity alone isaiah god the father sent jesus to earth for salvation of mankind john ousia is essence or being in eastern christianity and is the aspect of god that is completely to mankind and human perception it is all that subsists by itself and which has not its being in another god the father and god the son and god the holy spirit all being uncreated according to the teaching of arius the pre existent logos and thus the incarnate jesus christ was begotten being only the son was directly begotten by god the father before ages but was of distinct though similar essence or substance from the creator his opponents argued that this would make jesus less than god and that this was heretical much of the distinction between the differing factions was over the phrasing that christ expressed in the new testament to express submission to god the father the theological term for this submission is kenosis this ecumenical council declared that jesus christ was distinct being of god in existence or reality hypostasis which the latin fathers translated as persona jesus was god in essence being and or nature ousia which the latin fathers translated as substantia constantine is believed to have exiled those who refused to accept the nicean creed arius himself the deacon euzoios and the libyan bishops theonas of marmarica and secundus of ptolemais and also the bishops who signed the creed but refused to join in condemnation of arius eusebius of nicomedia and theognis of nicaea the emperor also ordered all copies of the thalia the book in which arius had expressed his teachings to be burned however there is no evidence that his son and ultimate successor constantius ii who was an arian christian was exiled although he was committed to maintaining what the church had defined at nicaea constantine was also bent on pacifying the situation and eventually became more lenient toward those condemned and exiled at the council first he allowed eusebius of nicomedia who was protégé of his sister and theognis to return once they had signed an ambiguous statement of faith the two and other friends of arius worked for arius rehabilitation at the first synod of tyre in ad they brought accusations against athanasius now bishop of alexandria the primary opponent of arius after this constantine had athanasius banished since he considered him an impediment to reconciliation in the same year the synod of jerusalem under constantine direction readmitted arius to communion in ad arius died on the way to this event in constantinople some scholars suggest that arius may have been poisoned by his opponents eusebius and theognis remained in the emperor favor and when constantine who had been catechumen much of his adult life accepted baptism on his deathbed it was from eusebius of nicomedia the historian jacob burckhardt wrote of the council aftermath of nicaea the council of nicaea did not end the controversy as many bishops of the eastern provinces disputed the homoousios the central term of the nicene creed as it had been used by paul of samosata who had advocated monarchianist christology both the man and his teaching including the term homoousios had been condemned by the synods of antioch in hence after constantine death in open dispute resumed again constantine son constantius ii who had become emperor of the eastern part of the empire actually encouraged the arians and set out to reverse the nicene creed his advisor in these affairs was eusebius of nicomedia who had already at the council of nicea been the head of the arian party who also was made bishop of constantinople constantius used his power to exile bishops adhering to the nicene creed especially st athanasius of alexandria who fled to rome in constantius became the sole emperor and extended his pro arian policy toward the western provinces frequently using force to push through his creed even exiling pope liberius and installing antipope felix ii the third council of sirmium in was the high point of arianism the seventh arian confession second sirmium confession held that both homoousios of one substance and homoiousios of similar substance were unbiblical and that the father is greater than the son this confession was later known as the blasphemy of sirmium but since many persons are disturbed by questions concerning what is called in latin substantia but in greek ousia that is to make it understood more exactly as to coessential or what is called like in essence there ought to be no mention of any of these at all nor exposition of them in the church for this reason and for this consideration that in divine scripture nothing is written about them and that they are above men knowledge and above men understanding as debates raged in an attempt to come up with new formula three camps evolved among the opponents of the nicene creed the first group mainly opposed the nicene terminology and preferred the term homoiousios alike in substance to the nicene homoousios while they rejected arius and his teaching and accepted the equality and coeternality of the persons of the trinity because of this centrist position and despite their rejection of arius they were called semi arians by their opponents the second group also avoided invoking the name of arius but in large part followed arius teachings and in another attempted compromise wording described the son as being like homoios the father third group explicitly called upon arius and described the son as unlike anhomoios the father constantius wavered in his support between the first and the second party while harshly persecuting the third epiphanius of salamis labelled the party of basil of ancyra in semi arianism this is considered unfair by kelly who states that some members of the group were virtually orthodox from the start but disliked the adjective homoousios while others had moved in that direction after the out and out arians had come into the open the debates among these groups resulted in numerous synods among them the council of sardica in the council of sirmium in and the double council of rimini and seleucia in and no fewer than fourteen further creed formulas between and leading the pagan observer ammianus marcellinus to comment sarcastically the highways were covered with galloping bishops none of these attempts were acceptable to the defenders of nicene orthodoxy writing about the latter councils saint jerome remarked that the world awoke with groan to find itself arian after constantius death in his successor julian devotee of rome pagan gods declared that he would no longer attempt to favor one church faction over another and allowed all exiled bishops to return this resulted in further increasing dissension among nicene christians the emperor valens however revived constantius policy and supported the homoian party exiling bishops and often using force during this persecution many bishops were exiled to the other ends of the empire st hilary of poitiers to the eastern provinces these contacts and the common plight subsequently led to rapprochement between the western supporters of the nicene creed and the homoousios and the eastern semi arians council of constantinople it was not until the co reigns of gratian and theodosius that arianism was effectively wiped out among the ruling class and elite of the eastern empire theodosius wife st flacilla was instrumental in his campaign to end arianism valens died in the battle of adrianople in and was succeeded by theodosius who adhered to the nicene creed this allowed for settling the dispute two days after theodosius arrived in constantinople november he expelled the homoiousian bishop demophilus of constantinople and surrendered the churches of that city to gregory nazianzus the leader of the rather small nicene community there an act which provoked rioting theodosius had just been baptized by bishop acholius of thessalonica during severe illness as was common in the early christian world in february he and gratian had published an edict that all their subjects should profess the faith of the bishops of rome and alexandria the nicene faith or be handed over for punishment for not doing so although much of the church hierarchy in the east had opposed the nicene creed in the decades leading up to theodosius accession he managed to achieve unity on the basis of the nicene creed in at the second ecumenical council in constantinople group of mainly eastern bishops assembled and accepted the nicene creed of which was supplemented in regard to the holy spirit as well as some other changes see comparison between creed of and creed of this is generally considered the end of the dispute about the trinity and the end of arianism among the roman non germanic peoples among medieval germanic tribes the ceiling mosaic of the arian baptistry during the time of arianism flowering in constantinople the gothic convert ulfilas later the subject of the letter of auxentius cited above was sent as missionary to the gothic tribes across the danube mission favored for political reasons by emperor constantius ii ulfilas initial success in converting this germanic people to an arian form of christianity was strengthened by later events when the germanic peoples entered the provinces of the western roman empire and began founding their own kingdoms there most had been arian christians for more than century the conflict in the th century ad had seen arian and nicene factions struggling for control of the church in contrast among the arian german kingdoms established in the collapsing western empire in the th century there were entirely separate arian and nicene churches with parallel hierarchies each serving different sets of believers the germanic elites were arians and the romance majority population was nicene most germanic tribes were generally tolerant of the nicene beliefs of their subjects however the vandals tried for several decades to force their arian beliefs on their north african nicene subjects exiling nicene clergy dissolving monasteries and exercising heavy pressure on non conforming nicene christians the apparent resurgence of arianism after nicaea was more an anti nicene reaction exploited by arian sympathizers than pro arian development by the end of the th century it had surrendered its remaining ground to trinitarianism in western europe arianism which had been taught by ulfilas the arian missionary to the germanic tribes was dominant among the goths lombards and vandals by the th century it had ceased to be the tribes mainstream belief as the tribal rulers gradually came to adopt nicene orthodoxy this trend began in with clovis of the franks then reccared of the visigoths in and aripert of the lombards in the franks and the anglo saxons were unlike the other germanic peoples in that they entered the empire as pagans and converted to chalcedonian christianity directly guided by their kings clovis and æthelberht of kent the remaining tribes the vandals and the ostrogoths did not convert as people nor did they maintain territorial cohesion having been militarily defeated by the armies of emperor justinian the remnants were dispersed to the fringes of the empire and became lost to history the vandalic war of dispersed the defeated vandals following their final defeat at the battle of mons lactarius in the ostrogoths went back north and re settled in south austria once the orthodox trinitarians succeeded in defeating arianism they censored any signs that the perceived heresy left behind this mosaic in basilica of sant apollinare nuovo in ravenna has had images of the arian king theoderic and his court removed on some columns their hands remain from the th to the th century much of south eastern europe and central europe including many of the goths and vandals respectively had embraced arianism the visigoths converted to arian christianity in which led to arianism being religious factor in various wars in the roman empire in the west organized arianism survived in north africa in hispania and parts of italy until it was finally suppressed in the th and th centuries grimwald king of the lombards and his young son and successor garibald were the last arian kings in europe from the th to the th century following the protestant reformation from it did not take long for arian and other non trinitarian views to resurface the first recorded english antitrinitarian was john assheton who was forced to recant before thomas cranmer in at the anabaptist council of venice the early italian instigators of the radical reformation committed to the views of miguel servetus burned alive by calvin in and these were promulgated by giorgio biandrata and others into poland and transylvania the antitrinitarian wing of the polish reformation separated from the calvinist ecclesia maior to form the ecclesia minor or polish brethren these were commonly referred to as arians due to their rejection of the trinity though in fact the socinians as they were later known went further than arius to the position of photinus the epithet arian was also applied to the early unitarians such as john biddle though in denial of the pre existence of christ they were again largely socinians not arians in the th century the dominant trend in britain particularly in was towards arianism with which the names of samuel clarke benjamin hoadly william whiston and isaac newton are associated to quote the encyclopædia britannica article on arianism in modern times some unitarians are virtually arians in that they are unwilling either to reduce christ to mere human being or to attribute to him divine nature identical with that of the father however their doctrines cannot be considered representative of traditional arian doctrines or vice versa similar view was held by the ancient anti nicene pneumatomachi greek breath or spirit and fighters combining as fighters against the spirit so called because they opposed the deifying of the nicene holy ghost however the pneumatomachi were adherents of macedonianism and though their beliefs were somewhat reminiscent of arianism they were distinct enough to be distinguishably different the iglesia ni cristo is one of the largest groups that teaches similar doctrine though they are really closer to socinianism believing the word in john is god plan of salvation not christ so christ did not preexist today the teachings of the first two ecumenical councils which entirely reject arianism are held by the catholic church the eastern orthodox church the oriental orthodox churches the assyrian church of the east and all churches founded during the reformation in the th century or influenced by it lutheran reformed presbyterian and anglican also nearly all protestant groups such as methodists baptists and most pentecostals entirely reject the teachings associated with arianism modern groups which currently appear to embrace some of the principles of arianism include unitarians and jehovah witnesses although the origins of their beliefs are not necessarily attributed to the teachings of arius many of the core beliefs of unitarians and jehovah witnesses are entirely similar to them jehovah witnesses jehovah witnesses are often referred to as modern day arians or they are sometimes referred to as semi arians usually by their opponents while there are some significant similarities in theology and doctrine the witnesses differ from arians by saying that the son can fully know the father something which arius himself denied and by their denial of personality to the holy spirit the original arians also generally prayed directly to jesus whereas the witnesses pray to god through jesus as mediator others the church of god th day salem conference line of sabbatarian adventists hold views similar to arianism other groups which oppose the belief in the trinity are not necessarily arian the iglesia ni cristo church of god general conference and other biblical unitarians are typically socinian in their christology not arian there are also various binitarian churches which basically believe that god is two persons the father and the son but they believe that the holy spirit is not person they include the church of god seventh day and its various offshoots in particular the former radio church of god founded by herbert armstrong renamed the worldwide church of god which after armstrong death converted to trinitarianism causing many small breakaway churches to form and most of them remain loyal to the teachings of armstrong for example the restored church of god the united church of god the philadelphia church of god the living church of god and many others other binitarian churches include the gospel assemblies group of pentecostal denominations which believe that god adopted the name jesus and the church of jesus christ bickertonite an offshoot of mormonism which believes that god is two personages not two persons binitarian churches generally believe that the father is greater than the son view somewhat similar to arianism see also references notes bibliography part part ii part iii part iv part part vi part vii part viii further reading external links

abalone or via spanish from the rumsen language aulón is common name for any of group of small to very large sea snails marine gastropod molluscs in the family haliotidae other common names are ear shells sea ears and muttonfish or muttonshells in australia ormer in great britain perlemoen in south africa and in new zealand abalone are marine snails their taxonomy puts them in the family haliotidae which contains only one genus haliotis which once contained six subgenera these subgenera have become alternate representations of haliotis the number of species recognized worldwide ranges between and with over species level taxa described the most comprehensive treatment of the family considers species valid with additional subspecies the shells of abalones have low open spiral structure and are characterized by several open respiratory pores in row near the shell outer edge the thick inner layer of the shell is composed of nacre mother of pearl which in many species is highly iridescent giving rise to range of strong changeable colors which make the shells attractive to humans as decorative objects jewelry and as source of colorful mother of pearl the flesh of abalones is widely considered to be desirable food and is consumed raw or cooked by variety of cultures description iridescent surface inside red abalone shell from northern california the adjacent coin is mm in diameter abalone vary in size from haliotis pulcherrima to while haliotis rufescens is the largest of the genus at the shell of abalones is convex rounded to oval in shape and may be highly arched or very flattened the shell of the majority of species has small flat spire and two to three whorls the last whorl known as the body whorl is auriform meaning that the shell resembles an ear giving rise to the common name ear shell haliotis asinina has somewhat different shape as it is more elongated and distended the shell of haliotis cracherodii cracherodii is also unusual as it has an ovate form is imperforate shows an exserted spire and has prickly ribs mantle cleft in the shell impresses groove in the shell in which are the row of holes characteristic of the genus these holes are respiratory apertures for venting water from the gills and for releasing sperm and eggs into the water column they make up what is known as the selenizone which forms as the shell grows this series of to holes is near the anterior margin only small number are generally open the older holes are gradually sealed up as the shell grows and new holes form each species has typical number of open holes between four and ten in the selenizone an abalone has no operculum the aperture of the shell is very wide and nacreous the exterior of the shell is striated and dull the color of the shell is very variable from species to species which may reflect the animal diet the iridescent nacre that lines the inside of the shell varies in color from silvery white to pink red and green red to deep blue green to purple the animal has fimbriated head lobes and side lobes which are fimbriated and cirrated the radula has small median teeth and the lateral teeth are single and beam like there are about uncini with denticulated hooks the first four very large the rounded foot is very large in comparison to most molluscs the soft body is coiled around the columellar muscle and its insertion instead of being on the columella is on the middle of the inner wall of the shell the gills are symmetrical and both well developed these snails cling solidly with their broad muscular foot to rocky surfaces at sublittoral depths although some species such as haliotis cracherodii used to be common in the intertidal zone abalones reach maturity at relatively small size their fecundity is high and increases with their size laying from to million eggs at time the spermatozoa are filiform and pointed at one end and the anterior end is rounded head the adults provide no further assistance to the larvae and they are described as lecithotrophic the adults are herbivorous and feed with their rhipidoglossan radula on macroalgae preferring red or brown algae distribution abalone with live sponge on its shell in póvoa de varzim portugal the haliotid family has worldwide distribution along the coastal waters of every continent except the pacific coast of south america the east coast of the united states the arctic and antarctica the majority of abalone species are found in cold waters such as off the coasts of new zealand south africa australia western north america and japan structure and properties of the shell the shell of the abalone is exceptionally strong and is made of microscopic calcium carbonate tiles stacked like bricks between the layers of tiles is clingy protein substance when the abalone shell is struck the tiles slide instead of shattering and the protein stretches to absorb the energy of the blow material scientists around the world are studying this tiled structure for insight into stronger ceramic products such as body armor the dust created by grinding and cutting abalone shell is dangerous appropriate safeguards must be taken to protect people from inhaling these particles diseases and pests abalones are subject to various diseases the victorian department of primary industries said in that ganglioneuritis killed up to of stock in affected regions abalone are also severe hemophiliacs as their fluids will not clot in the case of laceration or puncture wound members of the spionidae family of the polychaetes are known as pests of abalone human use the meat foot muscle of abalone is used for food and the shells of abalone are used as decorative items and as source of mother of pearl for jewelry buttons buckles and inlay abalone shells have been found in archaeological sites around the world ranging from year old deposits at blombos cave in south africa to historic chinese abalone middens on california northern channel islands on the channel islands where abalones were harvested by native americans for at least years the size of red abalone shells found in middens declines significantly after about years ago probably due to human predation worldwide abalone pearls have also been collected for centuries farming an abalone farm abalone hatchery multi species fish and invertebrate breeding and hatchery oceanographic marine laboratory lucap alaminos pangasinan philippines farming of abalone began in the late and early in japan and china since the mid there have been many increasingly successful endeavors to commercially farm abalone for the purpose of consumption overfishing and poaching have reduced wild populations to such an extent that farmed abalone now supplies most of the abalone meat consumed the principal abalone farming regions are china taiwan japan and korea abalone is also farmed in australia canada chile france iceland ireland mexico namibia new zealand south africa spain thailand and the united states after trials in commercial sea ranch was set up in flinders bay western australia to raise abalone the ranch is based on an artificial reef made up of separate concrete units called abitats abalone habitats the abitats can host abalone each the reef is seeded with young abalone from an onshore hatchery the abalone feed on seaweed that has grown naturally on the habitats with the ecosystem enrichment of the bay also resulting in growing numbers of dhufish pink snapper wrasse samson fish among other species brad adams from the company has emphasised the similarity to wild abalone and the difference from shore based aquaculture we re not aquaculture we re ranching because once they re in the water they look after themselves consumption abalones have long been valuable food source for humans in every area of the world where species is abundant the meat of this mollusc is considered delicacy in certain parts of latin america especially chile france new zealand southeast asia and east asia especially in china vietnam japan and korea in chinese speaking regions abalone is commonly known as bao yu and sometimes forms part of chinese banquet in the same way as shark fin soup or bird nest soup abalone is considered luxury item and is traditionally reserved for special occasions such as weddings and other celebrations however the availability of commercially farmed abalone has allowed more common consumption of this once rare delicacy abalone started to become popular after the panama pacific international exposition in as abalone became more popular and less common the prices adjusted accordingly in the restaurant served portion of abalone about ounces would cost in inflation adjusted dollars about by the price had risen to in america prior to this time abalone was predominantly eaten gathered and prepared by chinese immigrants before that abalone were collected to be eaten and used for other purposes by native american tribes by laws were passed in california to outlaw the taking of abalone above the intertidal zone this forced the chinese out of the market and the japanese perfected diving with or without gear to enter the market by the time of the exposition americans were starting to discover abalone the popularity of abalone along with many other fish and shellfish increased as the exposition exhibited varieties of fish with cooking demonstrations and seat dining hall in japan live and raw abalones are used in awabi sushi or served steamed salted boiled chopped or simmered in soy sauce salted fermented abalone entrails are the main component of tottsuru local dish from honshū tottsuru is mainly enjoyed with sake in california abalone meat can be found on pizza sautéed with caramelized mango or in steak form dusted

scuba diving for abalone in the states of new south wales and western australia is illegal free diving catch limit of two is allowed victoria has had an active abalone fishery since the late the state is sectioned into three fishing zones eastern central and western with each fisher required zone allocated licence harvesting is performed by divers using surface supplied air hookah systems operating from runabout style outboard powered boats while the diver seeks out colonies of abalone amongst the reef beds the deckhand operates the boat known as working live and stays above where the diver is working bags of abalone pried from the rocks are brought to the surface by the diver or by way of shot line where the deckhand drops weighted rope for the catch bag to be connected then retrieved divers measure each abalone before removing from the reef and the deckhand remeasures each abalone and removes excess weed growth from the shell since the victorian industry has seen significant decline in catches with the total allowable catch reduced from to tonnes for the fishing year due to dwindling stocks and most notably the abalone virus ganglioneuritis which is fast spreading and lethal to abalone stocks united states workers drying abalone shells in the sun in southern california circa two highly endangered white abalone prohibitions on commercial and recreational harvest of this species have been in place since sport harvesting of red abalone is permitted with california fishing license and an abalone stamp card in the abalone card also came with set of tags this was reduced to abalone per year in and as of the limit has been reduced to only nine of which may be taken south of mendocino county legal size abalone must be tagged immediately abalone may only be taken using breath hold techniques or shorepicking scuba diving for abalone is strictly prohibited taking of abalone is not permitted south of the mouth of the san francisco bay size minimum of measured across the shell is in place person may be in possession of only three abalone at any given time as of abalone season is may to october excluding july transportation of abalone may only legally occur while the abalone is still attached in the shell sale of sport obtained abalone is illegal including the shell only red abalone may be taken as black white pink flat green and pinto abalone are protected by law an abalone diver is normally equipped with thick wetsuit including hood bootees and gloves and usually also mask snorkel weight belt abalone iron and abalone gauge alternatively the rock picker can feel underneath rocks at low tides for abalone abalone are mostly taken in depths from few inches up to less common are freedivers who can work deeper than abalone are normally found on rocks near food sources such as kelp an abalone iron is used to pry the abalone from the rock before it has time to fully clamp down divers dive from boats kayaks tube floats or directly off the shore the largest abalone recorded in california is caught by john pepper somewhere off the coast of san mateo county in september the mollusc concholepas concholepas is often sold in the united states under the name chilean abalone though it is not an abalone but muricid new zealand in new zealand abalone is called pāua from the māori language haliotis iris or blackfoot pāua is the ubiquitous new zealand pāua the highly polished nacre of which is extremely popular as souvenirs with its striking blue green and purple iridescence haliotis australis and haliotis virginea are also found in new zealand waters but are less popular than iris like all new zealand shellfish recreational harvesting of pāua does not require permit provided catch limits size restrictions and seasonal and local restrictions set by the ministry for primary industries mpi are followed the legal recreational daily limit is per diver with minimum shell length of for iris and for australis in addition no person may be in possession even on land of more than pāua or more than of pāua meat at any one time pāua can only be caught by free diving it is illegal to catch them using scuba gear an extensive global black market exists in collecting and exporting abalone meat this can be particularly awkward problem where the right to harvest pāua can be granted legally under māori customary rights when such permits to harvest are abused it is frequently difficult to police the limit is strictly enforced by roving ministry for primary industries fishery officers with the backing of the new zealand police poaching is major industry in new zealand with many thousands being taken illegally often undersized convictions have resulted in seizure of diving gear boats and motor vehicles and fines and in rare cases imprisonment south africa the largest abalone in south africa haliotis midae occurs along roughly two thirds of the country coastline abalone diving has been recreational activity for many years but stocks are currently being threatened by illegal commercial harvesting in south africa all persons harvesting this shellfish need permits that are issued annually and no abalone may be harvested using scuba gear for the last few years however no permits have been issued for collecting abalone but commercial harvesting still continues as does illegal collection by syndicates in because of widespread poaching of abalone the south african government listed abalone as an endangered species according to the cites section iii appendix which requests member governments to monitor the trade in this species this listing was removed from cites in june by the south african government and south african abalone is no longer subject to cites trade controls export permits are still

the wholesale price for abalone meat was approximately us per kilogram there is an active trade in the shells which sell for more than us per metric tonne channel islands britanny and normandy ormers haliotis tuberculata are considered delicacy in the british channel islands as well as in adjacent areas of france and are pursued with great alacrity by the locals this and recent lethal bacterial disease has led to dramatic depletion in numbers since the latter half of the th century and ormering is now strictly regulated in order to preserve stocks the gathering of ormers is now restricted to number of ormering tides from january to april which occur on the full or new moon and two days following no ormers may be taken from the beach that are under in shell length gatherers are not allowed to wear wetsuits or even put their heads underwater any breach of these laws is criminal offense and can lead to fine of up to or six months in prison the demand for ormers is such that they led to

decorative item in jewelry buttons and as inlay in furniture and in musical instruments such as guitars etc abalone pearl jewelry is very popular in new zealand and australia in no minor part due to the marketing and farming efforts of pearl companies unlike the oriental natural the akoya pearl and the south sea and tahitian cultured pearls abalone pearls are not primarily judged by their roundness the inner shell of the abalone is an iridescent swirl of intense colours ranging from deep cobalt blue and peacock green to purples creams and pinks therefore each pearl natural or cultured will have its own unique collage of colours the shells of abalone are occasionally used in new age smudging ceremonies to catch falling ash they have also been used as incense burners native use abalone has been an important staple in native cultures around the world specifically in africa and on the north american west coast the meat was used as food and the shell was used as currency for

abalone are on the federal endangered species list and possible restoration sites have been proposed for the san clemente island and santa barbara island areas the possibility of farming abalone to be reintroduced into the wild has also been proposed with these abalone having special tags to help track the population species the number of species that are recognized within the genus haliotis has

jobs had the idea of selling the computer the apple was apple first product and to finance its creation jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation vw microbus for few hundred dollars and wozniak sold his hp calculator for however wozniak said that jobs planned to use his bicycle if necessary it was demonstrated in july at the homebrew computer club in palo alto california production

history introductory advertisement for the apple computer on march steve wozniak attended the first meeting of the homebrew computer club in gordon french garage he was so inspired that he immediately set to work on what would become the apple computer after building it for himself and showing it at the club he and steve jobs gave out schematics technical designs for the computer to interested club members and even helped some of them build and test out copies then steve jobs suggested that they design and sell single etched and silkscreened circuit board just the bare board no electronic parts that people could use to build the computers wozniak calculated that having the board design laid out would cost and manufacturing would cost another per board he hoped to recoup his costs if people bought the boards for each to fund this small venture their first company jobs sold his van and wozniak sold his hp calculator very soon after steve jobs arranged to sell something like completely built computers to the byte shop computer store in mountain view california at each to fulfill the order they obtained in parts at days net and delivered the finished product in days the apple went on

sold through august despite the introduction of the apple ii in april which began shipping in june of that year in october the apple was officially discontinued and removed from apple price list as

an anagram is word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of different word or phrase typically using all the original letters exactly once for example the word anagram can be rearranged into nag ram the original word or phrase is known as the subject of the anagram any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram someone who creates anagrams may be called an anagrammatist and the goal of serious or skilled anagrammatist is to produce anagrams that reflect or comment on their subject examples anagrams don necessarily have to use all letters but they normally do anagrams may be created as commentary on the subject for example it may be synonym or antonym of its subject parody criticism satire rail safety fairy tales roast beef eat for bse it sometimes changes proper noun or personal name into sentence william shakespeare am weakish speller madam curie radium came it can change parts of speech such as the adjective silent to the verb listen anagrams itself can be anagrammatized as ars magna latin the great art history anagrams can be traced back to the time of the ancient greeks and were then known as themuru or changing which was to find the hidden and mystical meaning in names they were popular throughout europe during the middle ages for example with the poet and composer guillaume de machaut they are said to go back at least to the greek poet lycophron in the third century bce but this relies on an account of lycophron given by john tzetzes in the th century anagrams in latin were considered witty over many centuries est vir qui adest explained below was cited as the example in samuel johnson dictionary of the english language any historical material on anagrams must always be interpreted in terms of the assumptions and spellings that were current for the language in question in particular spelling in english only slowly became fixed there were attempts to regulate anagram formation an important one in english being that of george puttenham of the anagram or posy transposed in the art of english poesie influence of latin as literary game when latin was the common property of the literate latin anagrams were prominent two examples are the change of ave maria gratia plena dominus tecum hail mary full of grace the lord is with you into virgo serena pia munda et immaculata serene virgin pious clean and spotless and the anagrammatic answer to pilate question quid est veritas what is truth namely est vir qui adest it is the man who is here the origins of these are not documented latin continued to influence letter values such as and vv there was an ongoing tradition of allowing anagrams to be perfect if the letters were all used once but allowing for these interchanges this can be seen in popular latin anagram against the jesuits societas jesu turned into vitiosa seces or cut off the wicked things puttenham in the time of elizabeth of england wished to start from elissabet anglorum regina elizabeth queen of the english to obtain multa regnabis ense gloria by thy sword shalt thou reign in great renown he explains carefully that is note of aspiration only and no letter and that in greek or hebrew is mere ss the rules were not completely fixed in the th century william camden in his remains commented singling out some letters and not found in the classical roman alphabet early modern period when it comes to the th century and anagrams in english or other languages there is great deal of documented evidence of learned interest the lawyer thomas egerton was praised through the anagram gestat honorem he carries honor the physician george ent took the anagrammatic motto genio surget he rises through spirit genius which requires his first name as georgius james courtiers discovered in james stuart just master and converted charles james stuart into claims arthur seat even at that point in time the letters and were more or less interchangeable walter quin tutor to the future charles worked hard on multilingual anagrams on the name of father james notorious murder scandal the overbury case threw up two imperfect anagrams that were aided by typically loose spelling and were recorded by simonds ewes francis howard for frances carr countess of somerset her maiden name spelled in variant became car findes whore with the letters hardly counted and the victim thomas overbury as thomas overburie was written as busie murther an old form of murder with counted as william drummond of hawthornden in an essay on the character of perfect anagram tried to lay down rules for permissible substitutions such as standing for and letter omissions william camden provided definition of anagrammatisme as dissolution of name truly written into his letters as his elements and new connection of it by artificial transposition without addition subtraction or change of any letter into different words making some perfect sense applyable applicable to the person named dryden in macflecknoe disdainfully called the pastime the torturing of one poor word ten thousand ways eleanor audeley wife of sir john davies is said to have been brought before the high commission in for extravagances stimulated by the discovery that her name could be transposed to reveale daniel and to have been laughed out of court by another anagram submitted by sir john lambe the dean of the arches dame eleanor davies never soe mad ladie an example from france was flattering anagram for cardinal richelieu comparing him to hercules or at least one of his hands hercules being kingly symbol where armand de richelieu became ardue main hercule difficult hand of hercules modern period examples from the nineteenth century are the transposition of horatio nelson into honor est nilo latin honor is from the nile and of florence nightingale into flit on cheering angel the victorian love of anagramming as recreation is alluded to by augustus de morgan using his own name as example great gun do us sum is attributed to his son william de morgan but family friend john thomas graves was prolific and manuscript with over has been preserved with the advent of surrealism as poetic movement anagrams regained the artistic respect they had had in the baroque period the german poet unica zürn who made extensive use of anagram techniques came to regard obsession with anagrams as dangerous fever because it created isolation of the author the surrealist leader andré breton coined the anagram avida dollars for salvador dalí to tarnish his reputation by the implication of commercialism applications while anagramming is certainly recreation first there are ways in which anagrams are put to use and these can be more serious or at least not quite frivolous and formless for example psychologists use anagram oriented tests often called anagram solution tasks to assess the implicit memory of young adults and adults alike establishment of priority natural philosophers astronomers and others of the th century transposed their discoveries into latin anagrams to establish their priority in this way they laid claim to new discoveries before their results were ready for publication galileo used for altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi have observed the most distant planet to have triple form for discovering the rings of saturn in galileo announced his discovery that venus had phases like the moon in the form haec immatura me iam frustra leguntur oy latin these immature ones have already been read in vain by me oy that is when rearranged cynthiae figuras aemulatur mater amorum latin the mother of loves venus imitates the figures of cynthia the moon when robert hooke discovered hooke law in he first published it in anagram form ceiiinosssttuv for ut tensio sic vis latin as the tension so the force in related use from british naturalist sir peter scott coined the scientific term nessiteras rhombopteryx greek for the monster or wonder of ness with the diamond shaped fin for the apocryphal loch ness monster shortly afterwards several london newspapers pointed out that nessiteras rhombopteryx anagrams into monster hoax by sir peter however robert rines who previously made two underwater photographs allegedly showing the monster countered with the fact that they can also be arranged into yes both pix are monsters pseudonyms anagrams are connected to pseudonyms by the fact that they may conceal or reveal or operate somewhere in between like mask that can establish identity for example jim morrison used an anagram of his name in the doors song woman calling himself mr mojo risin the use of anagrams and fabricated personal names may be to circumvent restrictions on the use of real names as happened in the th century when edward cave wanted to get around restrictions imposed on the reporting of the house of commons in genre such as farce or parody anagrams as names may be used for pointed and satiric effect pseudonyms adopted by authors are sometimes transposed forms of their names thus calvinus becomes alcuinus here or françois rabelais alcofribas nasier the name voltaire of françois marie arouet fits this pattern and is allowed to be an anagram of arouet le jeune that is arouet the younger other examples include arrigo boito tobia gorrio edward gorey ogdred weary regera dowdy or deadworry and others vladimir nabokov vivian darkbloom vivian bloodmark blavdak vinomori or dorian vivalkomb ted morgan sanche de gramont dave barry ray adverb glen duncan declan gunn damon albarn dan abnormal anna madrigal man and girl tom marvolo riddle am lord voldemort buckethead death cube daniel clowes enid coleslaw siobhán donaghy shanghai nobody several of these are imperfect anagrams letters having been left out in some cases for the sake of easy pronunciation titles anagrams used for titles afford scope for some types of wit examples homer hickam jr book rocket boys was adapted into the film october sky the tapes for the revival of the bbc show doctor who were labeled with the anagram torchwood which later went on to be used as the name for spin off show the tv series the team had season anagram episode called black day at bad rock word play on the spenser tracy western movie bad day at black rock the new wave band missing persons best selling album was called spring session hip hop artist mf doom recorded album called mm food brian eno album before and after science includes song entitled king lead hat an anagram of talking heads band eno has worked with juan maria solare piano ballad jura ser anomalía literally he she swears to be an anomaly is an anagram of the composer full name his composition for english horn titled dot in time is an anagram of

anagrams are in themselves recreational activity but they also make up part of many other games puzzles and game shows the jumble is puzzle found in many newspapers in the united states requiring the unscrambling of letters to find the solution cryptic crossword puzzles frequently use anagrammatic clues usually indicating that they are anagrams by the inclusion of descriptive term like confused or in disarray an example would be businessman burst into tears letters the solution stationer is an anagram of into tears the letters of which have burst out of their original arrangement to form the name of type of businessman numerous other games and contests involve some element of anagram formation as basic skill some examples in anagrams players flip tiles over one at time and race to take words they can steal each other words by rearranging the letters and extending the words in version of scrabble called clabbers the name itself being an anagram of scrabble tiles may be placed in any order on the board as long as they anagram to valid word on the british game show countdown contestants are given seconds to make the longest word from nine random letters in boggle players make constrained words from grid of sixteen random letters by joining adjacent cubes on the british game show brainteaser contestants are shown word broken into randomly arranged segments and must announce the whole word at the end of the game there is pyramid which starts with three letter word letter appears in the line below to which the player must add the existing letters to find solution the pattern continues until the player reaches the final eight letter anagram the player wins the game by solving all the anagrams within the allotted time in bananagrams players place tiles from pool into crossword style word arrangements in race to see who can finish the pool of tiles first other anagram games include bonza word game bookworm video game dabble jumble letterpress video game perquackey puzzlage word force wordspot and words with friends ciphers multiple anagramming is technique used to solve some kinds of cryptograms such as permutation cipher transposition cipher and the jefferson disk solutions may be computationally found using jumble algorithm methods of construction sometimes it is possible to see anagrams in words unaided by tools though the more letters involved the more difficult this becomes anagram dictionaries could also be used computer programs known as anagram servers anagram solvers or anagrammers offer much faster route to creating anagrams and large number of these programs are available on the internet the program or server carries out an exhaustive search of database of words to produce list containing every possible combination of words or phrases from the input word or phrase using jumble algorithm some programs such as lexpert restrict to one word answers many anagram servers for example the words oracle can control the search results by excluding or including certain words limiting the number or length of words in each anagram or limiting the number of results anagram solvers are often banned from online anagram games the disadvantage of computer anagram solvers especially when applied to multi word anagrams is their poor understanding of the meaning of the words they are manipulating they usually cannot filter out meaningful or appropriate anagrams from large numbers of nonsensical word combinations some servers attempt to improve on this using statistical techniques that try to combine only words that appear together often this approach provides only limited success since it fails to recognize ironic and humorous combinations some anagrammatists indicate the method they used anagrams constructed without aid of computer are noted as having been done manually or by hand those made by utilizing computer may be noted by machine or by computer or may indicate the name of the computer program using anagram

amethyst is violet variety of quartz often used in jewelry the name comes from the koine greek ἀμέθυστος amethystos from not and μεθύσκω methysko μεθύω methyo intoxicate reference to the belief that the stone protected its owner from drunkenness the ancient greeks wore amethyst and carved drinking vessels from it in the belief that it would prevent intoxication it is one of several forms of quartz amethyst is semiprecious stone and is the traditional birthstone for february structure amethyst is purple variety of quartz sio and owes its violet color to irradiation iron impurities in some cases in conjunction with transition element impurities and the presence of trace elements which result in complex crystal lattice substitutions the hardness of the mineral is the same as quartz thus it is suitable for use in jewelry hue and tone amethyst occurs in primary hues from light pinkish violet to deep purple amethyst may exhibit one or both secondary hues red and blue the best varieties of amethyst can be found in siberia sri lanka brazil and the far east the ideal grade is called deep siberian and has primary purple hue of around with blue and depending on the light source red secondary hues green quartz is sometimes incorrectly called green amethyst which is misnomer and not an appropriate name for the material the proper terminology being prasiolite other names for green quartz are vermarine or lime citrine faceted amethystemerald cut amethyst of very variable intensity the color of amethyst is often laid out in stripes parallel to the final faces of the crystal one aspect in the art of lapidary involves correctly cutting the stone to place the color in way that makes the tone of the finished gem homogeneous often the fact that sometimes only thin surface layer of violet color is present in the stone or that the color is not homogeneous makes for difficult cutting the color of amethyst has been demonstrated to result from substitution by irradiation of trivalent iron fe for silicon in the structure in the presence of trace elements of large ionic radius and to certain extent the amethyst color can naturally result from displacement of transition elements even if the iron concentration is low natural amethyst is dichroic in reddish violet and bluish violet but when heated turns yellow orange yellow brown or dark brownish and may resemble citrine but loses its dichroism unlike genuine citrine when partially heated amethyst can result in ametrine amethyst can fade in tone if overexposed to light sources and can be artificially darkened with adequate irradiation history intaglio engraved gem of caracalla in amethyst once in the treasury of sainte chapelle uninscribed amethyst scarab at the center of string of amethyst ball beads middle kingdom from egypt the petrie museum of egyptian archaeology london amethyst was used as gemstone by the ancient egyptians and was largely employed in antiquity for intaglio engraved gems the greeks believed amethyst gems could prevent intoxication while medieval european soldiers wore amethyst amulets as protection in battle in the belief that amethysts heal people and keep them cool headed beads of amethyst were found in anglo saxon graves in england anglican bishops wear an episcopal ring often set with an amethyst an allusion to the description of the apostles as not drunk at pentecost in acts large geode or amethyst grotto from near santa cruz in southern brazil was presented at exhibition in düsseldorf germany in the th century the color of amethyst was attributed to the presence of manganese however since it can be greatly altered and even discharged by heat the color was believed by some authorities to be from an organic source ferric thiocyanate has been suggested and sulfur was said to have been detected in the mineral synthetic amethyst synthetic laboratory grown amethyst is produced by synthesis method called hydrothermal growth which grows the crystals inside high pressure autoclave synthetic amethyst is made to imitate the best quality amethyst its chemical and physical properties are the same to that of natural amethyst and it can not be differentiated with absolute certainty without advanced gemmological testing which is often cost prohibitive there is one test based on brazil law twinning form of quartz twinning where right and left hand quartz structures are combined in single crystal which can be used to identify synthetic amethyst rather easily it is possible to synthesize twinned amethyst but this type is not available in large quantities in the market single crystal quartz is very desirable in the industry particularly for keeping the regular vibrations necessary for quartz movements in watches and clocks which is where lot of synthetic quartz is used treated amethyst is produced by gamma ray ray or electron beam irradiation of clear quartz rock crystal which has been first doped with ferric impurities on exposure to heat the irradiation effects can be partially cancelled and amethyst generally becomes yellow or even green and much of the citrine cairngorm or yellow quartz of jewelry is said to be merely burnt amethyst cultural history ancient greece the greek word amethystos may be translated as not drunken from greek not methustos intoxicated amethyst was considered to be strong antidote against drunkenness which is why wine goblets were often carved from it in his poem amethyste ou les amours de bacchus et amethyste amethyst or the loves of bacchus and amethyste the french poet remy belleau invented myth in which bacchus the god of intoxication of wine and grapes was pursuing maiden named amethyste who refused his affections amethyste prayed to the gods to remain chaste prayer which the chaste goddess diana answered transforming her into white stone humbled by amethyste desire to remain chaste bacchus poured wine over the stone as an offering dyeing the crystals purple variations of the story include that dionysus had been insulted by mortal and swore to slay the next mortal who crossed his path creating fierce tigers to carry out his wrath the mortal turned out to be beautiful young woman amethystos who was on her way to pay tribute to artemis her life was spared by artemis who transformed the maiden into statue of pure crystalline quartz to protect her from the brutal claws dionysus wept tears of wine in remorse for his action at the sight of the beautiful statue the god tears then stained the quartz purple this myth and its variations are not found in classical sources however the titan rhea does present dionysus with an amethyst stone to preserve the wine drinker sanity in historical text other cultural associations tibetans consider amethyst sacred to the buddha and make prayer beads from it amethyst is considered the birthstone of february in the middle ages it was considered symbol of royalty and used to decorate english regalia in the old world amethyst was considered one of the cardinal gems in that it was one of the five gemstones considered precious above all others until large deposits were found in brazil geographic distribution amethyst is produced in abundance from the state of minas gerais in brazil where it occurs in large geodes within volcanic rocks many of the hollow agates of southwestern brazil and uruguay contain crop of amethyst crystals in the interior artigas uruguay and neighboring brazilian state rio grande do sul are large world producers exceeding in quantity minas gerais as well as mato grosso espirito santo bahia and ceará states all amethyst producers of importance in brazil it is also found and mined in south korea the largest opencast amethyst vein in the world is in maissau lower austria much fine amethyst comes from russia especially from near mursinka in the ekaterinburg district where it occurs in drusy cavities in granitic rocks many localities in south india yield amethyst one of the largest global amethyst producers is zambia in southern africa with an annual production of about tons amethyst occurs at many localities in the united states among these may be mentioned the mazatzal mountain region in gila and maricopa counties arizona red feather lakes near ft collins colorado amethyst mountain texas yellowstone national park delaware county pennsylvania haywood county north carolina deer hill and stow maine and in the lake superior region of minnesota wisconsin and michigan amethyst is relatively common in the canadian provinces of ontario and nova scotia the largest amethyst mine in north america is located in thunder bay ontario an amethyst geode that formed when large crystals grew in open spaces inside the rock amethyst is the official state gemstone of south carolina several south carolina amethysts are on display at the smithsonian museum of natural history value up until the th century amethyst was included in the cardinal or most valuable gemstones along with diamond sapphire ruby and emerald however since the discovery of extensive deposits in locations such as brazil it has lost most of its value collectors look for depth of color possibly with red flashes if cut conventionally as amethyst is readily available in large structures the value of the gem is not primarily defined by carat weight this is different to most gemstones where the carat weight exponentially increases the value of the stone the biggest factor in the value of amethyst is the color displayed the highest grade amethyst called deep russian is exceptionally rare and therefore when one is found its value is dependent on the demand of collectors it is however still orders of magnitude lower than the highest grade sapphires or rubies

polished stones fishing for amber on the coast of baltic sea winter storms throw out amber nuggets close to gdansk poland amber is fossilized tree resin which has been appreciated for its color and natural beauty since neolithic times much valued from antiquity to the present as gemstone amber is made into variety of decorative objects amber is used in jewelry it has also been used as healing agent in folk medicine there are five classes of amber defined on the basis of their chemical constituents because it originates as soft sticky tree resin amber sometimes contains animal and plant material as inclusions amber occurring in coal seams is also called resinite and the term ambrite is applied to that found specifically within new zealand coal seams etymology the english word amber derives from arabic cognate with middle persian ambar via middle latin ambar and middle french ambre the word was adopted in middle english in the th century as referring to what is now known as ambergris ambre gris or grey amber solid waxy substance derived from the sperm whale in the romance languages the sense of the word had come to be extended to baltic amber fossil resin from as early as the late th century at first called white or yellow amber ambre jaune this meaning was adopted in english by the early th century as the use of ambergris waned this became the main sense of the word the two substances yellow amber and grey amber conceivably became associated or confused because they both were found washed up on beaches ambergris is less dense than water and floats whereas amber is too dense to float though less dense than stone the classical names for amber latin electrum and ancient greek ēlektron are connected to term ἠλέκτωρ ēlektōr meaning beaming sun according to myth when phaëton son of helios the sun was killed his mourning sisters became poplar trees and their tears became elektron amber history amber is discussed by theophrastus in the th century bc and again by pytheas bc whose work on the ocean is lost but was referenced by pliny the elder according to whose the natural history in what is also the earliest known mention of the name germania pytheas says that the gutones people of germany inhabit the shores of an estuary of the ocean called mentonomon their territory extending distance of six thousand stadia that at one day sail from this territory is the isle of abalus upon the shores of which amber is thrown up by the waves in spring it being an excretion of the sea in concrete form as also that the inhabitants use this amber by way of fuel and sell it to their neighbors the teutones earlier pliny says that large island of three days sail from the scythian coast called balcia by xenophon of lampsacus author of fanciful travel book in greek is called basilia by pytheas it is generally understood to be the same as abalus based on the amber the island could have been heligoland zealand the shores of bay of gdansk the sambia peninsula or the curonian lagoon which were historically the richest sources of amber in northern europe it is assumed that there were well established trade routes for amber connecting the baltic with the mediterranean known as the amber road pliny states explicitly that the germans export amber to pannonia from where it was traded further abroad by the veneti the ancient italic peoples of southern italy were working amber the most important examples are on display at the national archaeological museum of siritide to matera amber used in antiquity as at mycenae and in the prehistory of the mediterranean comes from deposits of sicily pliny also cites the opinion of nicias according to whom amber is liquid produced by the rays of the sun and that these rays at the moment of the sun setting striking with the greatest force upon the surface of the soil leave upon it an unctuous sweat which is carried off by the tides of the ocean and thrown up upon the shores of germany besides the fanciful explanations according to which amber is produced by the sun pliny cites opinions that are well aware of its origin in tree resin citing the native latin name of succinum sūcinum from sucus juice he writes amber is produced from marrow discharged by trees belonging to the pine genus like gum from the cherry and resin from the ordinary pine it is liquid at first which issues forth in considerable quantities and is gradually hardened our forefathers too were of opinion that it is the juice of tree and for this reason gave it the name of succinum and one great proof that it is the produce of tree of the pine genus is the fact that it emits pine like smell when rubbed and that it burns when ignited with the odour and appearance of torch pine wood he also states that amber is also found in egypt and in india and he even refers to the electrostatic properties of amber by saying that in syria the women make the whorls of their spindles of this substance and give it the name of harpax from ἁρπάζω to drag from the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it chaff and the light fringe of tissues pliny says that the german name of amber was glæsum for which reason the romans when germanicus cæsar commanded the fleet in those parts gave to one of these islands the name of glæsaria which by the barbarians was known as austeravia this is confirmed by the recorded old high german glas and old english glær for amber glass in middle low german amber was known as berne barn börnstēn the low german term became dominant also in high german by the th century thus modern german bernstein besides dutch dutch barnsteen the baltic lithuanian term for amber is gintaras and latvian dzintars they and the slavic jantar or hungarian gyanta resin are thought to originate from phoenician jainitar sea resin early in the nineteenth century the first reports of amber from north america came from discoveries in new jersey along crosswicks creek near trenton at camden and near woodbury composition and formation amber is heterogeneous in composition but consists of several resinous bodies more or less soluble in alcohol ether and chloroform associated with an insoluble bituminous substance amber is macromolecule by free radical polymerization of several precursors in the labdane family communic acid cummunol and biformene these labdanes are diterpenes and trienes equipping the organic skeleton with three alkene groups for polymerization as amber matures over the years more polymerization takes place as well as isomerization reactions crosslinking and cyclization heated above amber decomposes yielding an oil of amber and leaves black residue which is known as amber colophony or amber pitch when dissolved in oil of turpentine or in linseed oil this forms amber varnish or amber lac formation molecular polymerization resulting from high pressures and temperatures produced by overlying sediment transforms the resin first into copal sustained heat and pressure drives off terpenes and results in the formation of amber for this to happen the resin must be resistant to decay many trees produce resin but in the majority of cases this deposit is broken down by physical and biological processes exposure to sunlight rain microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi and extreme temperatures tends to disintegrate resin for resin to survive long enough to become amber it must be resistant to such forces or be produced under conditions that exclude them botanical origin amber from bitterfeld fossil resins from europe fall into two categories the famous baltic ambers and another that resembles the agathis group fossil resins from the americas and africa are closely related to the modern genus hymenaea while baltic ambers are thought to be fossil resins from sciadopityaceae family plants that used to live in north europe inclusions baltic amber with inclusions the abnormal development of resin in living trees succinosis can result in the formation of amber impurities are quite often present especially when the resin dropped onto the ground so the material may be useless except for varnish making such impure amber is called firniss such inclusion of other substances can cause amber to have an unexpected color pyrites may give bluish color bony amber owes its cloudy opacity to numerous tiny bubbles inside the resin however so called black amber is really only kind of jet in darkly clouded and even opaque amber inclusions can be imaged using high energy high contrast high resolution rays extraction and processing distribution and mining amber mine primorskoje in jantarny kaliningrad oblast russia amber is globally distributed mainly in rocks of cretaceous age or younger historically the samland coast west of königsberg in prussia was the world leading source of amber the first mentions of amber deposits here date back to the th century about of the world extractable amber is still located in that area which became the kaliningrad oblast of russia in pieces of amber torn from the seafloor are cast up by the waves and collected by hand dredging or diving elsewhere amber is mined both in open works and underground galleries then nodules of blue earth have to be removed and an opaque crust must be cleaned off which can be done in revolving barrels containing sand and water erosion removes this crust from sea worn amber blue amber from dominican republic caribbean amber especially dominican blue amber is mined through bell pitting which is dangerous due to the risk of tunnel collapse treatment the vienna amber factories which use pale amber to manufacture pipes and other smoking tools turn it on lathe and polish it with whitening and water or with rotten stone and oil the final luster is given by friction with flannel when gradually heated in an oil bath amber becomes soft and flexible two pieces of amber may be united by smearing the surfaces with linseed oil heating them and then pressing them together while hot cloudy amber may be clarified in an oil bath as the oil fills the numerous pores to which the turbidity is due small fragments formerly thrown away or used only for varnish are now used on large scale in the formation of ambroid or pressed amber the pieces are carefully heated with exclusion of air and then compressed into uniform mass by intense hydraulic pressure the softened amber being forced through holes in metal plate the product is extensively used for the production of cheap jewelry and articles for smoking this pressed amber yields brilliant interference colors in polarized light amber has often been imitated by other resins like copal and kauri gum as well as by celluloid and even glass baltic amber is sometimes colored artificially but also called true amber appearance amber occurs in range of different colors as well as the usual yellow orange brown that is associated with the color amber amber itself can range from whitish color through pale lemon yellow to brown and almost black other uncommon colors include red amber sometimes known as cherry amber green amber and even blue amber which is rare and highly sought after yellow amber is hard fossil resin from evergreen trees and despite the name it can be translucent yellow orange or brown colored known to the iranians by the pahlavi compound word kah ruba from kah straw plus rubay attract snatch referring to its electrical properties which entered arabic as kahraba or kahraba which later became the arabic word for electricity كهرباء kahrabā it too was called amber in europe old french and middle english ambre found along the southern shore of the baltic sea yellow amber reached the middle east and western europe via trade its coastal acquisition may have been one reason yellow amber came to be designated by the same term as ambergris moreover like ambergris the resin could be burned as an incense the resin most popular use was however for ornamentation easily cut and polished it could be transformed into beautiful jewelry much of the most highly prized amber is transparent in contrast to the very common cloudy amber and opaque amber opaque amber contains numerous minute bubbles this kind of amber is known as bony amber although all dominican amber is fluorescent the rarest dominican amber is blue amber it turns blue in natural sunlight and any other partially or wholly ultraviolet light source in long wave uv light it has very strong reflection almost white only about is found per year which makes it valuable and expensive sometimes amber retains the form of drops and stalactites just as it exuded from the ducts and receptacles of the injured trees it is thought that in addition to exuding onto the surface of the tree amber resin also originally flowed into hollow cavities or cracks within trees thereby leading to the development of large lumps of amber of irregular form classification amber can be classified into several forms most fundamentally there are two types of plant resin with the potential for fossilization terpenoids produced by conifers and angiosperms consist of ring structures formed of isoprene units phenolic resins are today only produced by angiosperms and tend to serve functional uses the extinct medullosans produced third type of resin which is often found as amber within their veins the composition of resins is highly variable each species produces unique blend of chemicals which can be identified by the use of pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry the overall chemical and structural composition is used to divide ambers into five classes there is also separate classification of amber gemstones according to the way of production class this class is by far the most abundant it comprises labdatriene carboxylic acids such as communic or ozic acids it is further split into three sub classes classes ia and ib utilize regular labdanoid diterpenes communic acid communol biformenes while ic uses enantio labdanoids ozic acid ozol enantio biformenes ia includes succinite normal baltic amber and glessite have communic acid base they also include much succinic acid baltic amber yields on dry distillation succinic acid the proportion varying from about to and being greatest in the pale opaque or bony varieties the aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid hence the name succinite succinite has hardness between and which is rather greater than that of many other fossil resins its specific gravity varies from to it can be distinguished from other ambers via ir spectroscopy due to specific carbonyl absorption peak ir spectroscopy can detect the relative age of an amber sample succinic acid may not be an original component of amber but rather degradation product of abietic acid ib like class ia ambers these are based on communic acid however they lack succinic acid ic this class is mainly based on enantio labdatrienonic acids such as ozic and zanzibaric acids its most familiar representative is dominican amber dominican amber differentiates itself from baltic amber by being mostly transparent and often containing higher number of fossil inclusions this has enabled the detailed reconstruction of the ecosystem of long vanished tropical forest resin from the extinct species hymenaea protera is the source of dominican amber and probably of most amber found in the tropics it is not succinite but retinite class ii these ambers are formed from resins with sesquiterpenoid base such as cadinene class iii these ambers are polystyrenes class iv class iv is something of wastebasket its ambers are not polymerized but mainly consist of cedrene based class class resins are considered to be produced by pine or pine relative they comprise mixture of diterpinoid resins and alkyl compounds their main variety is highgate copalite geological record typical amber specimen with number of indistinct inclusions the oldest amber recovered dates to the upper carboniferous period its chemical composition makes it difficult to match the amber to its producers it is most similar to the resins produced by flowering plants however there are no flowering plant fossils until the cretaceous and they were not common until the upper cretaceous amber becomes abundant long after the carboniferous in the early cretaceous when it is found in association with insects the oldest amber with arthropod inclusions comes from the levant from lebanon and jordan this amber roughly million years old is considered of high scientific value providing evidence of some of the oldest sampled ecosystems in lebanon more than outcrops of lower cretaceous amber were discovered by dany azar lebanese paleontologist and entomologist among these outcrops have yielded biological inclusions comprising the oldest representatives of several recent families of terrestrial arthropods even older jurassic amber has been found recently in lebanon as well many remarkable insects and spiders were recently discovered in the amber of jordan including the oldest zorapterans clerid beetles umenocoleid roaches and achiliid planthoppers baltic amber or succinite historically documented as prussian amber is found as irregular nodules in marine glauconitic sand known as blue earth occurring in the lower oligocene strata of sambia in prussia in historical sources also referred to as glaesaria after this territory around königsberg was turned into kaliningrad oblast russia where amber is now systematically mined it appears however to have been partly derived from older eocene deposits and it occurs also as derivative phase in later formations such as glacial drift relics of an abundant flora occur as inclusions trapped within the amber while the resin was yet fresh suggesting relations with the flora of eastern asia and the southern part of north america heinrich göppert named the common amber yielding pine of the baltic forests pinites succiniter but as the wood does not seem to differ from that of the existing genus it has been also called pinus succinifera it is improbable however that the production of amber was limited to single species and indeed large number of conifers belonging to different genera are represented in the amber flora paleontological significance amber is unique preservational mode preserving otherwise unfossilizable parts of organisms as such it is helpful in the reconstruction of ecosystems as well as organisms the chemical composition of the resin however is of limited utility in reconstructing the phylogenetic affinity of the resin producer amber sometimes contains animals or plant matter that became caught in the resin as it was secreted insects spiders and even their webs annelids frogs crustaceans bacteria and amoebae marine microfossils wood flowers and fruit hair feathers and other small organisms have been recovered in cretaceous ambers deposited the oldest amber to bear fossils mites is from the carnian triassic of north eastern italy use solutrean of altamira mhnt amber has been used since prehistory solutrean in the manufacture of jewelry and ornaments and also in folk medicine jewelry amber has been used as jewelry since the stone age from years ago amber ornaments have been found in mycenaean tombs and elsewhere across europe to this day it is used in the manufacture of smoking and glassblowing mouthpieces amber place in culture and tradition lends it tourism value palanga amber museum is dedicated to the fossilized resin historic medicinal uses amber has long been used in folk medicine for its purported healing properties amber and extracts were used from the time of hippocrates in ancient greece for wide variety of treatments through the middle ages and up until the early twentieth century scent of amber and amber perfumery lithuanian amber jewelry in ancient china it was customary to burn amber during large festivities if amber is heated under the right conditions oil of amber is produced and in past times this was combined carefully with nitric acid to create artificial musk resin with peculiar musky odor although when burned amber does give off characteristic pinewood fragrance modern products such as perfume do not normally use actual amber due to the fact that fossilized amber produces very little scent in perfumery scents referred to as amber are often created and patented to emulate the opulent golden warmth of the fossil the modern name for amber is thought to come from the arabic word ambar meaning ambergris ambergris is the waxy aromatic substance created in the intestines of sperm whales and was used in making perfumes both in ancient times as well as modern the scent of amber was originally derived from emulating the scent of ambergris and or labdanum but due to the endangered species status of the sperm whale the scent of amber is now largely derived from labdanum the term amber is loosely used to describe scent that is warm musky rich and honey like and also somewhat earthy it can be synthetically created or derived from natural resins when derived from natural resins it is most often created out of labdanum benzoin is usually part of the recipe vanilla and cloves are

the family alligatoridae of crocodylians includes alligators and caimans true alligators the lineage including alligators proper alligatorinae occurs in the fluvial deposits of the age of the upper chalk in europe where they did not die out until the pliocene age the true alligators are today represented by two species in the southeastern united states which can grow to ft and weigh lbs kg and the small sinensis in the yangtze river china which grows to an average of ft their name derives from the spanish el lagarto which means the lizard caimans in central and south america the alligator family is represented by six species of the subfamily caimaninae which differ from the alligator by the absence of bony septum between the nostrils and having ventral armour composed of overlapping bony scutes each of which is formed of two parts united by suture besides the three species in caiman the smooth fronted caimans in genus paleosuchus and the black caiman in melanosuchus are described caimans tend to be more agile and crocodile like in their movements and have longer sharper teeth than alligators crocodilus the spectacled caiman has the widest distribution from southern mexico to the northern half of argentina and grows to modest size of about the largest is the near threatened melanosuchus niger the jacare assu or large or black caiman of the amazon river basin black caimans grow to with the largest recorded size the black caiman and american alligator are the only members of the alligator family that pose the same danger to humans as the larger species of the crocodile family although caimans have not been studied in depth scientists have learned their mating cycles previously thought to be spontaneous or year round are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels which increases chances of survival for their offspring differences from crocodiles alligators differ from crocodiles principally in having wider and shorter heads with more obtuse snouts in having the fourth enlarged tooth of the under jaw received not into an external notch but into pit formed for it within the upper one in lacking jagged fringe which appears on the hind legs and feet of the crocodile in having the toes of the hind feet webbed not more than half way to the tips and an intolerance to salinity alligators strongly preferring fresh water while crocodiles can tolerate salt water due to specialized glands for filtering out salt in general crocodiles tend to be more dangerous to humans than alligators another recently discovered trait is that of both caimans and american alligators partaking of foliage and fruit in addition to their normal diet of fish and meat taxonomy an alligator nest at everglades national park florida united states olseni fore limb alligator prenasalis fossil superfamily alligatoroidea family alligatoridae subfamily alligatorinae genus albertochampsa genus alligator alligator mcgrewi alligator mefferdi american alligator alligator alligator olseni alligator prenasalis chinese alligator alligator sinensis genus genus arambourgia genus ceratosuchus genus chrysochampsa genus eoalligator genus hassiacosuchus genus hispanochampsa genus krabisuchus genus navajosuchus genus procaimanoidea genus wannaganosuchus subfamily caimaninae genus caiman yacare caiman caiman yacare spectacled caiman caiman crocodilus rio apaporis caiman apaporiensis brown caiman fuscus broad snouted caiman caiman latirostris caiman lutescans genus melanosuchus melanosuchus fisheri black caiman melanosuchus niger genus eocaiman genus mourasuchus genus necrosuchus genus orthogenysuchus genus paleosuchus cuvier dwarf caiman paleosuchus palpebrosus smooth fronted caiman paleosuchus trigonatus genus purussaurus references external links crocodilians natural history conservation crocodilian com family alligatoridae gray alligator fossilworks org
algol designated beta persei persei abbreviated beta per per known colloquially as the demon star is bright multiple star in the constellation of perseus it is the first and best known eclipsing binary and one of the first non nova variable stars to be discovered it is three star system consisting of beta persei aa aa and ab in which the large and bright primary persei aa is regularly eclipsed by the dimmer persei aa thus algol magnitude is usually near constant at but regularly dips to every days days hours and minutes during the roughly hour long partial eclipses there is also secondary eclipse the second minimum when the brighter star occults the fainter secondary this secondary eclipse can only be detected algol gives its name to its class of eclipsing variable known as algol variables observation history the algol system on august this is chara interferometer image with milliarcsecond resolution in the near infrared band the elongated appearance of algol aa labelled and the round appearance of algol aa labelled are real but the form of algol ab labelled is an artifact an ancient egyptian calendar of lucky and unlucky days composed some years ago is claimed to be the oldest historical document of the discovery of algol the association of algol with demon like creature gorgon in the greek tradition ghoul in the arabic tradition suggests that its variability was known long before the th century but except for the ancient egyptian discovery there is still no indisputable evidence for this the variability of algol was noted in by italian astronomer geminiano montanari but the periodic nature of its variations in brightness was not recognized until more than century later when the british amateur astronomer john goodricke also proposed mechanism for the star variability in may he presented his findings to the royal society suggesting that the periodic variability was caused by dark body passing in front of the star or else that the star itself has darker region that is periodically turned toward the earth for his report he was awarded the copley medal in the harvard astronomer edward charles pickering presented evidence that algol was actually an eclipsing binary this was confirmed few years later in when the potsdam astronomer hermann carl vogel found periodic doppler shifts in the spectrum of algol inferring variations in the radial velocity of this binary system thus algol became one of the first known spectroscopic binaries joel stebbins at the university of illinois observatory used an early selenium cell photometer to produce the first ever photoelectric study of variable star the light curve revealed the second minimum and the reflection effect between the two stars some difficulties in explaining the observed spectroscopic features led to the conjecture that third star may be present in the system four decades later this conjecture was found to be correct system chara interferometer in the near infrared band sorted according to orbital phase because some phases are poorly covered aa jumps at some points along its path interpolation of the orbit of aa around aa with focus on aa from the point of view of the earth algol aa and algol aa form an eclipsing binary because their orbital plane contains the line of sight to the earth to be more precise algol is triple star system the eclipsing binary pair is separated by only astronomical units au from each other whereas the third star in the system algol ab is at an average distance of au from the pair and the mutual orbital period of the trio is earth days the total mass of the system is about solar masses and the mass ratios of aa aa and ab are about to to the three components of the bright triple star used to be and still sometimes are referred to as per and the washington double star catalog lists them as aa aa and an with two very faint stars and about one arcmin distant further five faint stars are also listed as companions studies of algol led to the algol paradox in the theory of stellar evolution although components of binary star form at the same time and massive stars evolve much faster than the less massive stars the more massive component algol is still in the main sequence but the less massive algol is subgiant star at later evolutionary stage the paradox can be solved by mass transfer when the more massive star became subgiant it filled its roche lobe and most of the mass was transferred to the other star which is still in the main sequence in some binaries similar to algol gas flow can be seen this system also exhibits ray and radio wave flares the ray flares are thought to be caused by the magnetic fields of the and components interacting with the mass transfer the radio wave flares might be created by magnetic cycles similar to those of sunspots but because the magnetic fields of these stars are up to ten times stronger than the field of the sun these radio flares are more powerful and more persistent magnetic activity cycles in the active secondary component induce changes in its radius of gyration that have been linked to recurrent orbital period variations on the order of via the applegate mechanism mass transfer between the components is small in the algol system but could be significant source of period change in other algol type binaries algol is about light years from the sun but about million years ago it passed within light years of the solar system and its apparent magnitude was about which is considerably brighter than the star sirius is today because the total mass of the algol system is about solar masses at the closest approach this might have given enough gravity to perturb the oort cloud of the solar system somewhat and hence increase the number of comets entering the inner solar system however the actual increase in net cometary collisions is thought to have been quite small names beta persei is the star bayer designation the name algol derives from arabic raʾs al ghūl head raʾs of the ogre al ghūl see ghoul the english name demon star is direct translation of this in the international astronomical union organized working group on star names wgsn to catalog and standardize proper names for stars the wgsn first bulletin of july included table of the first two batches of names approved by the wgsn which included algol for this star it is so entered on the iau catalog of star names in hebrew folklore algol was called rōsh ha sāṭān or satan head as stated by edmund chilmead who called it divels head or rosch hassatan latin name for algol from the th century was caput larvae or the spectre head hipparchus and pliny made this separate though connected constellation in chinese meaning mausoleum refers to an asterism consisting of persei persei persei persei persei persei persei and persei consequently persei itself is known as english the fifth star of mausoleum according to allen the star bore the grim name of tseih she meaning piled up corpses but this appears to be and dié shī is correctly persei which is inside the mausoleum cultural significance historically the star has received strong association with bloody violence across wide variety of cultures in the tetrabiblos the nd century astrological text of the alexandrian astronomer ptolemy algol is referred to as the gorgon of perseus and associated with death by decapitation theme which mirrors the myth of the hero perseus victory over the snake haired gorgon medusa astrologically algol is considered one of the unluckiest stars in the sky and was listed as one of the behenian stars see also algol in fiction references external links

in thermodynamics an adiabatic process is one that occurs without transfer of heat or matter between thermodynamic system and its surroundings in an adiabatic process energy is transferred to its surroundings only as work the adiabatic process provides rigorous conceptual basis for the theory used to expound the first law of thermodynamics and as such it is key concept in thermodynamics some chemical and physical processes occur so rapidly that they may be conveniently described by the term adiabatic approximation meaning that there is not enough time for the transfer of energy as heat to take place to or from the system by way of example the adiabatic flame temperature is an idealization that uses the adiabatic approximation so as to provide an upper limit calculation of temperatures produced by combustion of fuel the adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature that would be achieved by flame if the process of combustion took place in the absence of heat loss to the surroundings description process that does not involve the transfer of heat or matter into or out of system so that is called an adiabatic process and such system is said to be adiabatically isolated the assumption that process is adiabatic is frequently made simplifying assumption for example the compression of gas within cylinder of an engine is assumed to occur so rapidly that on the time scale of the compression process little of the system energy can be transferred out as heat to the surroundings even though the cylinders are not insulated and are quite conductive that process is idealized to be adiabatic the same can be said to be true for the expansion process of such system the assumption of adiabatic isolation of system is useful one and is often combined with others so as to make the calculation of the system behaviour possible such assumptions are idealizations the behaviour of actual machines deviates from these idealizations but the assumption of such perfect behaviour provide useful first approximation of how the real world works according to laplace when sound travels in gas there is no time for heat conduction in the medium and so the propagation of sound is adiabatic for such an adiabatic process the modulus of elasticity young modulus can be expressed as where is the ratio of specific heats at constant pressure and at constant volume and is the pressure of the gas various applications of the adiabatic assumption for closed system one may write the first law of thermodynamics as where denotes the change of the system internal energy the quantity of energy added to it as heat and the work done on it by its surroundings if the system has rigid walls such that work cannot be transferred in or out and the walls of the system are not adiabatic and energy is added in the form of heat and there is no phase change the temperature of the system will rise if the system has rigid walls such that pressure volume work cannot be done and the system walls are adiabatic but energy is added as isochoric work in the form of friction or the stirring of viscous fluid within the system and there is no phase change the temperature of the system will rise if the system walls are adiabatic but not rigid and in fictive idealized process energy is added to the system in the form of frictionless non viscous pressure volume work and there is no phase change the temperature of the system will rise such process is called an isentropic process and is said to be reversible fictively if the process is reversed the energy added as work can be recovered entirely as work done by the system if the system contains compressible gas and is reduced in volume the uncertainty of the position of the gas is reduced and seemingly would reduce the entropy of the system but the temperature of the system will rise as the process is isentropic should the work be added in such way that friction or viscous forces are operating within the system then the process is not isentropic and if there is no phase change then the temperature of the system will rise the process is said to be irreversible and the work added to the system is not entirely recoverable in the form of work if the walls of system are not adiabatic and energy is transferred in as heat entropy is transferred into the system with the heat such process is neither adiabatic nor isentropic having and according to the second law of thermodynamics naturally occurring adiabatic processes are irreversible entropy is produced the transfer of energy as work into an adiabatically isolated system can be imagined as being of two idealized extreme kinds in one such kind there is no entropy produced within the system no friction viscous dissipation etc and the work is only pressure volume work denoted by in nature this ideal kind occurs only approximately because it demands an infinitely slow process and no sources of dissipation the other extreme kind of work is isochoric work for which energy is added as work solely through friction or viscous dissipation within the system stirrer that transfers energy to viscous fluid of an adiabatically isolated system with rigid walls without phase change will cause rise in temperature of the fluid but that work is not recoverable isochoric work is irreversible the second law of thermodynamics observes that natural process of transfer of energy as work always consists at least of isochoric work and often both of these extreme kinds of work every natural process adiabatic or not is irreversible with as friction or viscosity are always present to some extent adiabatic heating and cooling the adiabatic compression of gas causes rise in temperature of the gas adiabatic expansion against pressure or spring causes drop in temperature in contrast free expansion is an isothermal process for an ideal gas adiabatic heating occurs when the pressure of gas is increased from work done on it by its surroundings piston compressing gas contained within cylinder and raising the temperature where in many practical situations heat conduction through walls can be slow compared with the compression time this finds practical application in diesel engines which rely on the lack of heat dissipation during the compression stroke to elevate the fuel vapor temperature sufficiently to ignite it adiabatic heating occurs in the earth atmosphere when an air mass descends for example in katabatic wind foehn wind or chinook wind flowing downhill over mountain range when parcel of air descends the pressure on the parcel increases due to this increase in pressure the parcel volume decreases and its temperature increases as work is done on the parcel of air thus increasing its internal energy which manifests itself by rise in the temperature of that mass of air the parcel of air can only slowly dissipate the energy by conduction or radiation heat and to first approximation it can be considered adiabatically isolated and the process an adiabatic process adiabatic cooling occurs when the pressure on an adiabatically isolated system is decreased allowing it to expand thus causing it to do work on its surroundings when the pressure applied on parcel of air is reduced the air in the parcel is allowed to expand as the volume increases the temperature falls as its internal energy decreases adiabatic cooling occurs in the earth atmosphere with orographic lifting and lee waves and this can form pileus or lenticular clouds adiabatic cooling does not have to involve fluid one technique used to reach very low temperatures thousandths and even millionths of degree above absolute zero is via adiabatic demagnetisation where the change in magnetic field on magnetic material is used to provide adiabatic cooling also the contents of an expanding universe can be described to first order as an adiabatically cooling fluid see heat death of the universe rising magma also undergoes adiabatic cooling before eruption particularly significant in the case of magmas that rise quickly from great depths such as kimberlites such temperature changes can be quantified using the ideal gas law or the hydrostatic equation for atmospheric processes in practice no process is truly adiabatic many processes rely on large difference in time scales of the process of interest and the rate of heat dissipation across system boundary and thus are approximated by using an adiabatic assumption there is always some heat loss as no perfect insulators exist ideal gas reversible process for simple substance during an adiabatic process in which the volume increases the internal energy of the working substance must decrease the mathematical equation for an ideal gas undergoing reversible no entropy generation adiabatic process can be represented by the polytropic process equation where is pressure is volume and for this case where being the specific heat for constant pressure being the specific heat for constant volume is the adiabatic index and is the number of degrees of freedom for monatomic gas for diatomic gas and collinear molecules carbon dioxide for monatomic ideal gas and for diatomic gas such as nitrogen and oxygen the main components of air note that the above formula is only applicable to classical ideal gases and not bose einstein or fermi gases for reversible adiabatic processes it is also true that where is an absolute temperature this can also be written as example of adiabatic compression the compression stroke in gasoline engine can be used as an example of adiabatic compression the model assumptions are the uncompressed volume of the cylinder is one litre cm the gas within is the air consisting of molecular nitrogen and oxygen only thus diatomic gas with five degrees of freedom and so the compression ratio of the engine is that is the volume of uncompressed gas is reduced to by the piston and the uncompressed gas is at approximately room temperature and pressure warm room temperature of or and pressure of bar kpa typical sea level atmospheric pressure so our adiabatic constant for this example is about pa the gas is now compressed to volume we will assume this happens quickly enough that no heat can enter or leave the gas through the walls the adiabatic constant remains the same but with the resulting pressure unknown so solving for or bar note that this pressure increase is more than simple compression ratio would indicate this is because the gas is not only compressed but the work done to compress the gas also increases its internal energy which manifests itself by rise in the gas temperature and an additional rise in pressure above what would result from simplistic calculation of times the original pressure we can solve for the temperature of the compressed gas in the engine cylinder as well using the ideal gas law pv nrt is amount of gas in mol and the gas constant for that gas our initial conditions being kpa of pressure volume and of temperature our experimental constant nr is we know the compressed gas has and so we can solve for temperature that is final temperature of or or well above the ignition point of many fuels this is why high compression engine requires fuels specially formulated to not self ignite which would cause engine knocking when operated under these conditions of temperature and pressure or that supercharger with an intercooler to provide pressure boost but with lower temperature rise would be advantageous diesel engine operates under even more extreme conditions with compression ratios of or more being typical in order to provide very high gas temperature which ensures immediate ignition of the injected fuel adiabatic free expansion of gas for an adiabatic free expansion of an ideal gas the gas is contained in an insulated container and then allowed to expand in vacuum because there is no external pressure for the gas to expand against the work done by or on the system is zero since this process does not involve any heat transfer or work the first law of thermodynamics then implies that the net internal energy change of the system is zero for an ideal gas the temperature remains constant because the internal energy only depends on temperature in that case since at constant temperature the entropy is proportional to the volume the entropy increases in this case therefore this process is irreversible derivation of relation for adiabatic heating and cooling the definition of an adiabatic process is that heat transfer to the system is zero then according to the first law of thermodynamics where is the change in the internal energy of the system and is work done by the system any work done must be done at the expense of internal energy since no heat is being supplied from the surroundings pressure volume work done by the system is defined as however does not remain constant during an adiabatic process but instead changes along with it is desired to know how the values of and relate to each other as the adiabatic process proceeds for an ideal gas the internal energy is given by where is the number of degrees of freedom divided by two is the universal gas constant and is the number of moles in the system constant differentiating equation and use of the ideal gas law yields equation is often expressed as because now substitute equations and into equation to obtain factorize and divide both sides by after integrating the left and right sides from to and from to and changing the sides respectively exponentiate both sides and substitute with the heat capacity ratio and eliminate the negative sign to obtain therefore and derivation of relation for adiabatic heating and cooling substituting the ideal gas law into the above we obtain which simplifies to derivation of discrete formula the change in internal energy of system measured from state to state is equal to at the same time the work done by the pressure volume changes as result from this process is equal to since we require the process to be adiabatic the following equation needs to be true by the previous derivation rearranging gives substituting this into gives integrating substituting rearranging using the ideal gas law and assuming constant molar quantity as often happens in practical cases by the continuous formula or substituting into the previous expression for substituting this expression and in gives simplifying simplifying simplifying graphing adiabats an adiabat is curve of constant entropy in diagram some properties of adiabats on diagram are indicated these properties may be read from the classical behaviour of ideal gases except in the region where pv becomes small low temperature where quantum effects become important every adiabat asymptotically approaches both the axis and the axis just like isotherms each adiabat intersects each isotherm exactly once an adiabat looks similar to an isotherm except that during an expansion an adiabat loses more pressure than an isotherm so it has steeper inclination more vertical if isotherms are concave towards the north east direction then adiabats are concave towards the east north east if adiabats and isotherms are graphed at regular intervals of entropy and temperature respectively like altitude on contour map then as the eye moves towards the axes towards the south west it sees the density of isotherms stay constant but it sees the density of adiabats grow the exception is very near absolute zero where the density of adiabats drops sharply and they become rare see nernst theorem the following diagram is diagram with superposition of adiabats and isotherms image entropyandtemp png the isotherms are the red curves and the adiabats are the black curves the adiabats are isentropic volume is the horizontal axis and pressure is the vertical axis etymology the term adiabatic is an anglicization of the greek term ἀδιάβατος impassable used by xenophon of rivers it is used in the thermodynamic sense by rankine and adopted by maxwell in explicitly attributing the term to rankine the etymological origin corresponds here to an impossibility of transfer of energy as heat and of transfer of matter across the wall the greek word ἀδιάβατος is formed from privative not and διαβατός passable in turn deriving from διά through and βαῖνειν to walk go come conceptual significance in thermodynamic theory the adiabatic process has been important for thermodynamics since its early days it was important in the work of joule because it provided way of nearly directly relating quantities of heat and work for thermodynamic system that is enclosed by walls that do not allow mass transfer energy can pass in and out only as heat or work thus quantity of work can be related almost directly to an equivalent quantity of heat in cycle of two limbs the first is an isochoric adiabatic work process that adds to the system internal energy then an isochoric and workless heat transfer returns the system to its original state the first limb adds definite amount of energy and the second removes it accordingly rankine measured quantity of heat in units of work rather than as calorimetric quantity in rankine used quantity that he called the thermodynamic function that later was called entropy and at that time he wrote also of the curve of no transmission of heat which he later called an adiabatic curve besides it two isothermal limbs carnot cycle has two adiabatic limbs for the foundations of thermodynamics the conceptual importance of this was emphasized by bryan by carathéodory and by born the reason is that calorimetry presupposes type of temperature as already defined before the statement of the first law of thermodynamics such as one based on empirical scales such presupposition involves making the distinction between empirical temperature and absolute temperature rather the definition of absolute thermodynamic temperature is best left till the second law is available as conceptual basis in the eighteenth century the law of conservation of energy was yet to be fully formulated or established and the nature of heat was debated one approach to these problems was to regard heat measured by calorimetry as primary substance that is conserved in quantity by the middle of the nineteenth century it was recognized as form of energy and the law of conservation of energy was thereby also recognized the view that eventually established itself and is currently regarded as right is that the law of conservation of energy is primary axiom and that heat is to be analyzed as consequential in this light heat cannot be component of the total energy of single body because it is not state variable but rather is variable that describes process of transfer between two bodies the adiabatic process is important because it is logical ingredient of this current view divergent usages of the word adiabatic this present article is written from the viewpoint of macroscopic thermodynamics and the word adiabatic is used in this article in the traditional way of thermodynamics introduced by rankine it is pointed out in the present article that for example if compression of gas is rapid then there is little time for heat transfer to occur even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by definite wall in this sense rapid compression of gas is sometimes approximately or loosely said to be adiabatic though often far from isentropic even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by definite wall quantum mechanics and quantum statistical mechanics however use the word adiabatic in very different sense one that can at times seem almost opposite to the classical thermodynamic sense in quantum theory the word adiabatic can mean something perhaps near isentropic or perhaps near quasi static but the usage of the word is very different between the two disciplines on the one hand in quantum theory if perturbative element of compressive work is done almost infinitely slowly that is to say quasi statically it is said to have been done adiabatically the idea is that the shapes of the eigenfunctions change slowly and continuously so that no quantum jump is triggered and the change is virtually reversible while the occupation numbers are unchanged nevertheless there is change in the energy levels of one to one corresponding pre and post compression eigenstates thus perturbative element of work has been done without heat transfer and without introduction of random change within the system for example max born writes actually it is usually the adiabatic case with which we have to do the limiting case where the external force or the reaction of the parts of the system on each other acts very slowly in this case to very high approximation that is there is no probability for transition and the system is in the initial state after cessation of the perturbation such slow perturbation is therefore reversible as it is classically on the other hand in quantum theory if perturbative element of compressive work is done rapidly it randomly changes the occupation numbers of the eigenstates as well as changing their shapes in that theory such rapid change is said not to be adiabatic and the contrary word diabatic is applied to it one might guess that perhaps clausius if he were confronted with this in the now obsolete language he used in his day would have said that internal work was done and that heat was generated though not transferred in classical thermodynamics such rapid change would still be called adiabatic because the system is adiabatically isolated and there is no transfer of energy as heat the strong irreversibility of the change due to viscosity or other entropy production does not impinge on this classical usage thus for mass of gas in macroscopic thermodynamics words are so used that compression is sometimes loosely or approximately said to be adiabatic if it is rapid enough to avoid heat transfer even if the system is not adiabatically isolated but in quantum statistical theory compression is not called adiabatic if it is rapid even if the system is adiabatically isolated in the classical thermodynamic sense of the term the words are used differently in the two disciplines as stated just above see also cyclic process first law of thermodynamics heat burst isobaric process

abraxas gk αβραξασ variant form abrasax αβρασαξ was word of mystic meaning in the system of the gnostic basilides being there applied to the great archon gk megas archōn the princeps of the spheres gk ouranoi the word is found in gnostic texts such as the holy book of the great invisible spirit and also appears in the greek magical papyri it was engraved on certain antique gemstones called on that account abraxas stones which were used as amulets or charms as the initial spelling on stones was abrasax αβρασαξ the spelling of abraxas seen today probably originates in the confusion made between the greek letters sigma and xi in the latin transliteration the seven letters spelling its name may represent each of the seven classic planets the word may be related to abracadabra although other explanations exist there are similarities and differences between such figures in reports about basilides teaching ancient gnostic texts the larger greco roman magical traditions and modern magical and esoteric writings opinions abound on abraxas who in recent centuries has been claimed to be both an egyptian god and demon the swiss psychiatrist carl jung transcribed short gnostic treatise in attributed to basilides in alexandria called the seven sermons to the dead which called abraxas the supreme power of being transcending both god and the devil and unites all opposites into one being sources it is uncertain what the actual role and function of abraxas was in the basilidian system as our authorities see below often show no direct acquaintance with the doctrines of basilides himself as an archon gemstone carved with abraxas obverse and reverse in the system described by irenaeus the unbegotten father is the progenitor of nous and from nous logos from logos phronesis from phronesis sophia and dynamis from sophia and dynamis principalities powers and angels the last of whom create the first heaven they in turn originate second series who create second heaven the process continues in like manner until heavens are in existence the angels of the last or visible heaven being the authors of our world the ruler principem probably ton archonta of the heavens is abraxas and for this reason he contains within himself numbers the name occurs in the refutation of all heresies vii by hippolytus who appears in these chapters to have followed the exegetica of basilides after describing the manifestation of the gospel in the ogdoad and hebdomad he adds that the basilidians have long account of the innumerable creations and powers in the several stages of the upper world diastemata in which they speak of heavens and say that their great archon is abrasax because his name contains the number the number of the days in the year the sum of the numbers denoted by the greek letters in αβρασαξ according to the rules of isopsephy is as god epiphanius haer appears to follow partly irenaeus partly the lost compendium of hippolytus he designates abraxas more distinctly as the power above all and first principle the cause and first archetype of all things and mentions that the basilidians referred to as the number of parts mele in the human body as well as of days in the year the author of the appendix to tertullian de praescr haer who likewise follows hippolytus compendium adds some further particulars that abraxas gave birth to mind nous the first in the series of primary powers enumerated likewise by irenaeus and epiphanius that the world as well as the heavens was created in honour of abraxas and that christ was sent not by the maker of the world but by abraxas nothing can be built on the vague allusions of jerome according to whom abraxas meant for basilides the greatest god de vir ill the highest god dial adv lucif the almighty god comm in amos iii and the lord the creator comm in nah the notices in theodoret haer fab augustine haer and praedestinatus have no independent value it is evident from these particulars that abrasax was the name of the first of the archons and accordingly stood below sophia and dynamis and their progenitors but his position is not expressly stated so that the writer of the supplement to tertullian had some excuse for confusing him with the supreme god as an aeon abraxas from infernal dictionary th edition with the availability of primary sources such as those in the nag hammadi library the identity of abrasax remains unclear the holy book of the great invisible spirit for instance refers to abrasax as an aeon dwelling with sophia and other aeons of the pleroma dukias in the light of the luminary eleleth in several texts the luminary eleleth is the last of the luminaries spiritual lights that come forward and it is the aeon sophia associated with eleleth who encounters darkness and becomes involved in the chain of events that leads to the demiurge rule of this world and the salvage effort that ensues as such the role of aeons of eleleth including abraxas sophia and others pertains to this outer border of the pleroma that encounters the ignorance of the world of lack and interacts to rectify the error of ignorance in the world of materiality as demon the catholic church later deemed abraxas pagan god and ultimately branded him demon as documented in collin de plancy infernal dictionary abraxas or abracax is labeled the supreme god of the basilidians whom he describes as heretics of the second century he further indicated the basilidians attributed to abraxas the rule over skies and virtues in final statement on basilidians de plancy states that their view was that jesus christ was merely benevolent ghost sent on earth by abracax abrasax stones vast number of engraved stones are in existence to which the name abrasax stones has long been given one particularly fine example was included as part of the thetford treasure from fourth century norfolk uk the subjects are mythological and chiefly grotesque with various inscriptions in which αβρασαξ often occurs alone or with other words sometimes the whole space is taken up with the inscription in certain obscure magical writings of egyptian origin ἀβραξάς or ἀβρασάξ is found associated with other names which frequently accompany it on gems it is also found on the greek metal tesseræ among other mystic words the meaning of the legends is seldom intelligible but some of the gems are amulets and the same may be the case with nearly all print from bernard de montfaucon antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures band page ff plaque with different images of abraxas the abrasax image alone without external iconisms and either without or but simple inscription the abrasax imago proper is usually found with shield sphere or wreath and whip sword or sceptre cock head the body clad with armor and serpent tail there are however innumerable modifications of these figures lions hawks and eagles skins with or without mottos with or without trident and star and with or without reverses abrasax combined with other gnostic powers if in single instance this supreme being was represented in connection with powers of subordinate rank nothing could have been more natural than to represent it also in combination with its emanations the seven superior spirits the thirty aeons and the three hundred and sixty five cosmical genii and yet this occurs upon none of the relics as yet discovered whilst those with powers not belonging to the gnostic system are frequently met with abrasax with jewish symbols this combination predominates not indeed with symbolical figures but in the form of inscriptions such as iao eloai adonai sabaoth michael gabriel uriel onoel ananoel raphael japlael and many others the name ιαω to which σαβαωθ is sometimes added is found with this figure even more frequently than αβρασαξ and they are often combined beside an abrasax figure the following for instance is found ιαω αβρασαξ αδων ατα iao abrasax thou art the lord with the abrasax shield are also found the divine names sabaoth iao iao abrasax adonai abrasax etc abrasax with persian deities chiefly perhaps exclusively in combination with mithras and possibly few specimens with the mystical gradations of mithriaca upon gnostic relics abrasax with egyptian deities it is represented as figure with the sun god phre leading his chariot or standing upon lion borne by crocodile also as name in connection with isis phtha neith athor thot anubis horus and harpocrates in lotus leaf also with representation of the nile the symbol of prolificacy with agathodaemon chnuphis or with scarabs the symbols of the revivifying energies of nature abrasax with grecian deities sometimes as figure and again with the simple name in connection with the planets especially venus hecate and zeus richly engraved simple or ornamental representations of the journey of departed spirits through the starry world to amenti borrowed as those above named from the egyptian religion the spirit wafted from the earth either with or without the corpse and transformed at times into osiris or helios is depicted as riding upon the back of crocodile or lion guided in some instances by anubis and other genii and surrounded by stars and thus attended hastening to judgment and higher life representations of the judgment which like the preceding are either ornamental or plain and imitations of egyptian art with slight modifications and prominent symbols as the vessel in which anubis weighs the human heart as comprehending the entire life of man with all its errors worship and consecrating services were according to the testimony of origen in his description of tho ophitic diagram conducted with figurative representations in the secret assemblies of the gnostics unless indeed the statement on which this opinion rests designates as it readily may statue of glyptic workmanship it is uncertain if any of the discovered specimens actually represent the gnostic cultus and religious ceremonies although upon some may be seen an abrasax figure laying its hand upon person kneeling as though for baptism or benediction astrological groups the gnostics referred everything to astrology even the bardesenists located the inferior powers the seven twelve and thirty six among the planets in the zodiac and starry region as rulers of the celestial phenomena which influence the earth and its inhabitants birth and health wealth and allotment are considered to be mainly under their control other sects betray still stronger partiality for astrological conceits many of these specimens also are improperly ascribed to gnosticism but the gnostic origin of others is too manifest to allow of contradiction inscriptions of which there are three kinds those destitute of symbols or iconisms engraved upon stone iron lead and silver plates in greek latin coptic or other languages of amuletic import and in the form of prayers for health and protection those with some symbol as serpent in an oval form those with iconisms at times very small but often made the prominent object so that the legend is limited to single word or name sometimes the legends are as important as the images it is remarkable however that thus far none of the plates or medals found seem to have any of the forms or prayers reported by origen it is necessary to distinguish those specimens that belong to the proper gnostic period from such as are indisputably of later origin especially since there is strong temptation to place those of more recent date among the older class gallery file montfaucon abraxas xcf

plaque xcf plaque anguipede engraving from an abrasax stone in great majority of instances the name abrasax is associated with singular composite figure having chimera like appearance somewhat resembling basilisk or the greek primordial god chronos not to be confused with the greek titan cronus according to wallis budge as pantheus all god he appears on the amulets with the head of cock phœbus or of lion ra or mithras the body of man and his legs are serpents which terminate in scorpions types of the agathodaimon in his right hand he grasps club or flail and in his left is round or oval shield this form was also referred to as the anguipede budge surmised that abrasax was form of the adam kadmon of the kabbalists and the primal man whom god made in his own image some parts at least of the figure mentioned above are solar symbols and the basilidian abrasax is manifestly connected with the sun bellermann has speculated that the whole represents the supreme being with his five great emanations each one pointed out by means of an expressive emblem thus from the human body the usual form assigned to the deity forasmuch as it is written that god created man in his own image issue the two supporters nous and logos symbols of the inner sense and the quickening understanding as typified by the serpents for the same reason that had induced the old greeks to assign this reptile for an attribute to pallas his head cock represents phronesis the fowl being emblematical of foresight and vigilance his two hands bear the badges of sophia and dynamis the shield of wisdom and the scourge of power origin in the absence of other evidence to show the origin of these curious relics of antiquity the occurrence of name known as basilidian on patristic authority has not unnaturally been taken as sufficient mark of origin and the early collectors and critics assumed this whole group to be the work of gnostics during the last three centuries attempts have been made to sift away successively those gems that had no claim to be considered in any sense gnostic or specially basilidian or connected with abrasax the subject is one which has exercised the ingenuity of many savants but it may be said that all the engraved stones fall into three classes abrasax or stones of basilidian origin abrasaxtes or stones originating in ancient forms of worship and adapted by the gnostics abraxoïdes or stones absolutely unconnected with the doctrine of basilides while it would be rash to assert positively that no existing gems were the work of gnostics there is no valid reason for attributing all of them to such an origin the fact that the name occurs on these gems in connection with representations of figures with the head of cock lion or an ass and the tail of serpent was formerly taken in the light of what irenaeus says about the followers of basilides incantations by mystic names were characteristic of the hybrid gnosticism planted in spain and southern gaul at the end of the fourth century and at the beginning of the fifth which jerome connects with basilides and which according to his epist lxxv used the name abrasax it is therefore not unlikely that some gnostics used amulets though the confident assertions of modern writers to this effect rest on no authority isaac de beausobre properly calls attention to the significant silence of clement in the two passages in which he instructs the christians of alexandria on the right use of rings and gems and the figures which may legitimately be engraved on them paed ff ff but no attempt to identify the figures on existing gems with the personages of gnostic mythology has had any success and abrasax is the only gnostic term found in the accompanying legends that is not known to belong to other religions or mythologies the present state of the evidence therefore suggests that their engravers and the basilidians received the mystic name from common source now unknown magical papyri having due regard to the magic papyri in which many of the unintelligible names of the abrasax stones reappear besides directions for making and using gems with similar figures and formulas for magical purposes it can scarcely be doubted that many of these stones are pagan amulets and instruments of magic the magic papyri reflect the same ideas as the abrasax gems and often bear hebraic names of god the following example is illustrative conjure you by iaō sabaōth adōnai abrasax and by the great god iaeō the patriarchs are sometimes addressed as deities for which fact many instances may be adduced in the group iakoubia iaōsabaōth adōnai abrasax the first name seems to be composed of jacob and ya similarly entities considered angels in judaism are invoked as gods alongside abrasax thus conjure you by the god michaēl by the god souriēl by the god gabriēl by the god raphaēl by the god abrasax ablathanalba akrammachari in text pgm abrasax is identified as part of the true name which has been transmitted to the prophets of israel of the headless one who created heaven and earth who created night and day osoronnophris whom none has ever seen awesome and invisible god with an empty spirit the name also includes iaō and adōnai osoronnophris represents egyptian wsir wn nfr osiris the perfect being another identification with osiris is made in pgm vii you are not wine but the guts of osiris the guts of ablanathanalba akrammachamarei eee who has been stationed over necessity iakoub ia iaō sabaōth adōnai abrasax pgm viii on the other hand identifies abrasax as name of hermes thoth here the numerological properties of the name are invoked with its seven letters corresponding to the seven planets and its isopsephic value of corresponding to the days of the year thoth is also identified with abrasax in pgm lxxix am the soul of darkness abrasax the eternal one michaēl but my true name is thōouth thōouth one papyrus titled the monad or the eighth book of moses pgm xiii contains an invocation to supreme creator god abrasax is given as being the name of this god in the language of the baboons the papyrus goes on to describe cosmogonic myth about abrasax describing how he created the ogdoad by laughing his first laughter created light his second divided the primordial waters his third created the mind his fourth created fertility and procreation his fifth created fate his sixth created time as the sun and moon and his seventh and final laughter created the soul then from various sounds made by abrasax there arose the serpent python who foreknew all things the first man or fear and the god iaō who is lord of all the man fought with iaō and abrasax declared that iaō power would derive from both of the others and that iaō would take precedence over all the other gods this text also describes helios as an archangel of god abrasax the leyden papyrus recommends that this invocation be pronounced to the moon the magic word ablanathanalba which reads in greek the same backward as forward also occurs in the abrasax stones as well as in the magic papyri this word is usually conceded to be derived from the hebrew aramaic meaning thou art our father אב לן את and also occurs in connection with abrasax the following inscription is found upon metal plate in the carlsruhe museum авраσаξ αβλαναθ αναλβα etymology gaius julius hyginus fab gives abrax aslo therbeeo as names of horses of the sun mentioned by homerus the passage is miserably corrupt but it may not be accidental that the first three syllables make abraxas the proper form of the name is evidently abrasax as with the greek writers hippolytus epiphanias didymus de trin iii and theodoret also augustine and praedestinatus and in nearly all the legends on gems by probably euphonic inversion the translator of irenaeus and the other latin authors have abraxas which is found in the magical papyri and even though most sparingly on engraved stones the attempts to discover derivation for the name greek hebrew coptic or other have not been entirely successful egyptian claudius salmasius thought it egyptian but never gave the proofs which he promised bellermann thinks it compound of the egyptian words abrak and sax meaning the honorable and hallowed word or the word is adorable samuel sharpe finds in it an egyptian invocation to the godhead meaning hurt me not hebrew abraham geiger sees in it grecized form of ha berakhah the blessing meaning which king declares philologically untenable passerius derives it from abh father bara to create and negative the uncreated father giuseppe barzilai goes back for explanation to the first verse of the prayer attributed to rabbi nehunya ben hakanah the literal rendering of which is god with thy mighty right hand deliver the unhappy people forming from the initial and final letters of the words the word abrakd pronounced abrakad with the meaning the host of the winged ones angels but this extremely ingenious theory would at most explain only the mystic word abracadabra whose connection with abrasax is by no means certain greek wendelin discovers compound of the initial letters amounting to in numerical value of four hebrew and three greek words all written with greek characters ab ben rouach hakadōs sōtēria apo xylou father son spirit holy salvation from the cross according to note of isaac de beausobre jean hardouin accepted the first three of these taking the four others for the initials of the greek anthrōpoussōzōn hagiōi xylōi saving mankind by the holy cross isaac de beausobre derives abrasax from the greek habros and saō the beautiful the glorious savior perhaps the word may be included among those mysterious expressions discussed by adolf von harnack which belong to no known speech and by their singular collocation of vowels and consonants give evidence that they belong to some mystic dialect or take their origin from some supposed divine inspiration yet we may with better reason suppose that it came originally from foreign mythology and that the accident of its numerical value in greek merely caused it to be singled out at alexandria for religious use it is worth notice that μειθρασ and νειλοσ have the same value the egyptian author of the book de mysteriis in reply to porphyry vii admits preference of barbarous to vernacular names in sacred things urging peculiar sanctity in the languages of certain nations as the egyptians and assyrians and origen contra cels refers to the potent names used by egyptian sages persian magi and indian brahmins signifying deities

yggdrasil in norse religion asgard enclosure of the æsir is one of the nine worlds and home to the æsir tribe of gods it is surrounded by an incomplete wall attributed to hrimthurs riding the stallion svaðilfari according to gylfaginning odin and his wife frigg are the rulers of asgard one of asgard well known realms is valhalla in which odin rules attestations in the prose edda gylfi king of sweden before the arrival of the æsir under odin travels to asgard questions the three officials shown in the illumination concerning the æsir and is beguiled note that the officials have one eye sign of odin one of his attributes is that he can make the false seem true th century icelandic manuscript the primary sources regarding asgard come from the prose edda written in the th century by icelandic historian snorri sturluson and the poetic edda compiled in the th century from basis of much older skaldic poetry poetic edda völuspá the first poem of the work mentions many of the features and characters of asgard portrayed by snorri such as yggdrasil and iðavöllr asgard is composed of realms including valhalla thrudheim breidablik that are ruled by odin thor and baldr respectively prose edda the prose edda presents two views regarding asgard prologue in the prologue snorri offers euhemerized and christian influenced interpretation of the myths and tales of his forefathers asgard he conjectures is the home of the æsir singular ás in as ia making folk etymological connection between the three as that is the æsir were men of asia not gods who moved from asia to the north and some of which intermarried with the peoples already there snorri interpretation of the th century foreshadows th century views of indo european migration from the east snorri further writes that asgard is land more fertile than any other blessed also with great abundance of gold and jewels correspondingly the æsir excelled beyond all other people in strength beauty and talent snorri proposes the location of asgard as troy the center of the earth about it were kingdoms and chiefs one of them múnón married priam daughter tróán and had by her son trór pronounced thor in old norse the latter was raised in thrace at age he was whiter than ivory had hair lighter than gold and could lift bear skins at once he explored far and wide his father odin led migration to the northern lands where they took wives and had many children populating the entire north with aesir one of the sons of odin was yngvi founder of the ynglingar an early royal family of sweden these accounts were written years after the of iceland gylfaginning depiction of the creation of the world by odin vili and vé illustration by lorenz frølich in gylfaginning snorri presents the mythological version taken no doubt from his sources icelanders were still being converted at that time he could not present the myths as part of any current belief instead he resorts to debunking device gylfi king of sweden before the æsir travels to asgard and finds there large hall valhalla in section within are three officials three aesir kings whom gylfi in the guise of gangleri is allowed to question about the asgard and the æsir revelation of the ancient myths follows but at the end the palace and the people disappear in clap of thunder and gylfi finds himself alone on the plain having been deluded section in gylfi delusion ancient asgard was ruled by the senior god the all father who had twelve names he was the ruler of everything and the creator of heaven and earth section during complex creation myth in which the cosmic cow audhumbla licked búri free from the ice the sons of buri son bor who were odin vili and vé constructed the universe and put midgard in it as residence for the first human couple ask and embla whom they created from driftwood trees in section the sons of bor then constructed asgard to be identified with troy snorri insists in section as home for the æsir who were divinities odin is identified as the all father asgard is conceived as being on the earth rainbow bridge bifröst connects it to heaven section in asgard also is temple for the gods gladsheim and another for the goddesses vingólf the plain of idavoll is the centre of asgard section the gods hold court there every day at the well of urd beneath an ash tree yggdrasil debating the fates of men and gods the more immediate destinies of men are assigned by the norns section it also states thor is god as well long descriptions of the gods follow among the more memorable details are the valkyries the battle maidens whom odin sends to allot death or victory to soldiers section names valkyries and states that the source as the poetic edda poem grímnismál odin residence is valhalla to which he takes those slain in battle the einherjar section snorri quips there is huge crowd there and there will be many more still section they amuse themselves every day by fighting each other and then going to drink in the big hall toward the end of the chapter snorri becomes prophetic describing ragnarök the twilight of the gods much of it sounds like the apocalypse by which snorri christian can hardly fail to have been influenced it will begin with three winters of snow with no summers in between wars will follow then earthquakes and tidal waves the sky will split open and out will ride the sons of muspell intent on universal destruction they will try to enter heaven but bifröst will break section heimdall will blow his mighty horn gjöll and the æsir and einherjar will ride out to battle most of the æsir will die and asgard be destroyed snorri quotes his own source saying the sun will go black earth sink in the sea heaven be stripped of its bright stars section afterwards the earth rises again from the sea is fairer than before and where asgard used to be remnant of the æsir gather some coming up from hel and talk and play chess all day with the golden chessmen of the ancient æsir which they find in the grass section skáldskaparmál the th century skald þorbjörn dísarskáld is quoted in skáldskaparmál as stating thor has defended asgard and ygg odin people the gods with strength heimskringla ynglinga saga by the time of the ynglinga saga snorri had developed his concept of asgard further although the differences might be accounted for by his sources in the initial stanzas of the poem asagarth is the capital of asaland section of asia to the east of the tana kvísl or vana kvísl river kvísl is fork which snorri explains is the tanais or don river flowing into the black sea the river divides sweden the great concession to the viking point of view it is never called that prior to the vikings section the river lands are occupied by the vanir and are called vanaland or vanaheim it is unclear what people snorri thinks the vanes are whether the proto slavic venedi or the east germanic vandals who had been in that region at that time for well over years he does not say however the germanic names of the characters such as njord frey and vanlandi indicate he had the vandals in mind odin is the chief of asagarth from there he conducts and dispatches military expeditions to all parts of the world he has the virtue of never losing battle section when he is away his two brothers vili and vé rule asaland from asagarth on the border of sweden is mountain range running from northeast to southwest south of it are the lands of the turks where odin had possessions thus the mountains must be the caucasus mountains on the north are the uninhabitable fells which must be the tundra taiga country apparently the vikings did not encounter the urals or the uralics of the region snorri evidences no knowledge of them there also is no mention of troy which was not far from constantinople capital of the byzantine empire and militarily beyond the reach of the vikings troy cannot have been asagarth snorri realizes the reason being that the æsir in asaland were unsettled by the military activities of the romans that is of the byzantine empire as result odin led section of the æsir to the north looking for new lands in which to settle they used the viking route up the don and the volga through garðaríki viking russia from there they went to saxland germany and to the lands of gylfi in scandinavia section the historical view

referring to the celtic god of healing who was worshipped at the springs this word became åxhe in walloon and aix in french and subsequently aix la chapelle after charlemagne had his palatine chapel

german to the south from the rest of the west germanic speech area to the north aachen local dialect is called öcher platt and belongs to the ripuarian language history early history flint quarries on the lousberg schneeberg and königshügel first used during neolithic times bc attest to the long occupation of the site of aachen as do recent finds under the modern city elisengarten pointing to former settlement from the same period bronze age around bc settlement is evidenced by the remains of barrows burial mounds found for example on the klausberg during the iron age the area was settled by celtic peoples who were perhaps drawn by the marshy aachen basin hot sulphur springs where they worshipped grannus god of light and healing later the hectare roman spa resort town of aquae granni was according to legend founded by grenus under hadrian around ad instead the fictitious founder refers to the celtic god and it seems it was the roman th legion at the start of the st century ad that first channelled the hot springs into spa at büchel adding at the end of the same century the münstertherme spa two water pipelines and probable sanctuary dedicated to grannus kind of forum surrounded by colonnades connected the two spa complexes there was also an extensive residential area part of it inhabited by flourishing jewish community the romans built bathhouses near burtscheid temple precinct called vernenum was built near the modern kornelimünster walheim today remains have been found of three bathhouses including two fountains in the elisenbrunnen and the burtscheid bathhouse roman civil administration in aachen broke down between the end of the th and beginning of the th centuries rome withdrew its troops from the area but the town remained populated by the town came to

pilgrimage after th century painting after roman times pepin the short had castle residence built in the town due to the proximity of the hot springs and also for strategic reasons as it is located between the rhineland and northern france einhard mentions that in pepin spent both christmas and easter at aquis villa and he celebrated christmas in the town aquis and similarly easter which must have been sufficiently equipped to support the royal household for several months in the year of his coronation as king of the franks charlemagne came to spend christmas at aachen for the first time he remained there in mansion which he may have extended although there is no source attesting to any significant building activity at aachen in his time apart from the building of the palatine chapel since cathedral and the palace charlemagne spent most winters in aachen between and his death in aachen became the focus of his court and the political centre of his empire after his death the king was buried in the church which he had built his original tomb has been lost while his alleged remains are preserved in the karlsschrein the shrine where he was reburied after being declared saint his saintliness however was never officially acknowledged by the roman curia as such in otto was crowned king of east francia in the collegiate church built by charlemagne during the reign of otto ii the nobles revolted and the west franks under lothair raided aachen in the ensuing confusion aachen was attacked again by odo of champagne who attacked the imperial palace while conrad ii was absent odo relinquished it quickly and was killed soon afterwards the palace and town of aachen had fortifying walls built by order of emperor frederick barbarossa between and over the next years most kings of germany destined to reign over the holy roman empire were crowned in aachen the original audience hall built by charlemagne was torn down and replaced by the current city hall in the last king to be crowned here was ferdinand in during the middle ages aachen remained city of regional importance due to its proximity to flanders it achieved modest position in the trade in woollen cloths favoured by imperial privilege the city remained free imperial city subject to the emperor only but was politically far too weak to influence the policies of any of its neighbours the only dominion it had was over burtscheid neighbouring territory ruled by benedictine abbess it was forced to accept that all of its traffic must pass through the aachener reich even in the late th century the abbess of burtscheid was prevented from building road linking her territory to the neighbouring estates of the duke of jülich the city of aachen even deployed its handful of soldiers to chase away the road diggers as an imperial city aachen held certain political privileges that allowed it to remain independent of the troubles of europe for many years it remained direct vassal of the holy roman empire throughout most of the middle ages it was also the site of many important church councils including the council of and the council of council convened by the antipope paschal iii manuscript production aachen has proved an important site for the production of historical manuscripts under charlemagne purview both the ada gospels and the coronation gospels may have been produced in aachen in addition quantities of the other texts in the court library were also produced locally during the reign of louis the pious substantial quantities of ancient texts were produced at aachen including legal manuscripts such as the leges scriptorium group patristic texts including the five manuscripts of the bamberg pliny group finally under lothair texts of outstanding quality were still being produced this however marked the end of the period of manuscript production at aachen th th centuries siege of aachen by the spanish army of flanders under ambrogio spinola in view of aachen in in following the invasion of spanish troops from the netherlands rudolf deposed all protestant office holders in aachen and even went as far as expelling them from the city from the early th century aachen started to lose its power and influence first the coronations of emperors were moved from aachen to frankfurt this was followed by the religious wars and the great fire of after the destruction of most of the city in the rebuilding was mostly in the baroque style the decline of aachen culminated in when the french led by general charles dumouriez occupied aachen by the middle of the th century aachen had become attractive as spa not so much because of the effects of the hot springs on the health of its visitors but because aachen was then and remained well into the th century place of high level prostitution traces of this hidden agenda of the city history are found in the th century guidebooks to aachen as well as to the other spas the main indication for visiting patients ironically was syphilis only by the end of the th century had rheumatism become the most important object of cures at aachen and burtscheid aachen was chosen as the site of several important congresses and peace

alcaeus and sappho attic red figure kalathos bc staatliche inv alcaeus of mytilene alkaios th century bc was lyric poet from the greek island of lesbos who is credited with inventing the alcaic stanza he was included in the canonical list of nine lyric poets by the scholars of hellenistic alexandria he was an older contemporary and an alleged lover of sappho with whom he may have exchanged poems he was born into the aristocratic governing class of mytilene the main city of lesbos where he was involved in political disputes and feuds biography alcaeus probably authentic lesbian coin has been preserved bearing upon the obverse profile head of alcaeus and upon the reverse profile head of pittacus this coin is said to have belonged to fulvius ursinus it passed through various hands and collections into the royal museum at paris and was engraved by the chevalier visconti easby smith pittacus the broad outlines of the poet life are well known he was born into the aristocratic warrior class that dominated mytilene the strongest city state on the island of lesbos and by the end of the seventh century bc the most influential of all the north aegean greek cities with strong navy and colonies securing its trade routes in the hellespont the city had long been ruled by kings born to the penthilid clan but during the poet life the penthilids were spent force and rival aristocrats and their factions contended with each other for supreme power alcaeus and his older brothers were passionately involved in the struggle but experienced little success their political adventures can be understood in terms of three tyrants who came and went in succession melanchrus he was overthrown sometime between bc and bc by faction that in addition to the brothers of alcaeus included pittacus later renowned as one of the seven sages of greece alcaeus at that time was too young to be actively involved myrsilus it is not known when he came to power but some verses by alcaeus frag indicate that the poet his brothers and pittacus made plans to overthrow him and that pittacus subsequently betrayed them alcaeus and his brothers fled into exile where the poet later wrote drinking song in celebration of the news of the tyrant death frag pittacus the dominant political figure of his time he was voted supreme power by the political assembly of mytilene and appears to have governed well bc even allowing alcaeus and his faction to return home in peace sometime before bc mytilene fought athens for control of sigeion and alcaeus was old enough to participate in the fighting according to the historian herodotus the poet threw away his shield to make good his escape from the victorious athenians then celebrated the occasion in poem that he later sent to his friend melanippus it is thought that alcaeus travelled widely during his years in exile including at least one visit to egypt his older brother antimenidas appears to have served as mercenary in the army of nebuchadnezzar ii and probably took part in the conquest of askelon alcaeus wrote verses in celebration of antimenides return including mention of his valour in slaying the larger opponent frag and he proudly describes the military hardware that adorned their family home frag sappho and alcaeus by lawrence alma tadema the walters art museum alcaeus was contemporary and countryman of sappho and since both poets composed for the entertainment of mytilenean friends they had many opportunities to associate with each other on quite regular basis such as at the kallisteia an annual festival celebrating the island federation under mytilene held at the messon referred to as temenos in frs and where sappho performed publicly with female choirs alcaeus reference to sappho in terms more typical of divinity as holy pure honey smiling sappho fr may owe its inspiration to her performances at the festival the lesbian or aeolic school of poetry reached in the songs of sappho and alcaeus that high point of brilliancy to which it never after wards approached and it was assumed by later greek critics and during the early centuries of the christian era that the two poets were in fact lovers theme which became favourite subject in art as in the urn pictured above poetry the poetic works of alcaeus were collected into ten books with elaborate commentaries by the alexandrian scholars aristophanes of byzantium and aristarchus of samothrace sometime in the rd century bc and yet his verses today exist only in fragmentary form varying in size from mere phrases such as wine window into man fr to entire groups of verses and stanzas such as those quoted below fr alexandrian scholars numbered him in their canonic nine one lyric poet per muse among these pindar was held by many ancient critics to be pre eminent but some gave precedence to alcaeus instead the canonic nine are traditionally divided into two groups with alcaeus sappho and anacreon being monodists or solo singers with the following characteristics they composed and performed personally for friends and associates on topics of immediate interest to them they wrote in their native dialects alcaeus and sappho in aeolic dialect anacreon in ionic they preferred quite short metrically simple stanzas or strophes which they re used in many poems hence the alcaic and sapphic stanzas named after the two poets who perfected them or possibly invented them the other six of the canonic nine composed verses for public occasions performed by choruses and professional singers and typically featuring complex metrical arrangements that were never reproduced in other verses however this division into two groups is considered by some modern scholars to be too simplistic and often it is practically impossible to know whether lyric composition was sung or recited or whether or not it was accompanied by musical instruments and dance even the private reflections of alcaeus ostensibly sung at dinner parties still retain public function critics often seek to understand alcaeus in comparison with sappho the roman poet horace also compared the two describing alcaeus as more full throatedly singing see horace tribute below alcaeus himself seems to underscore the difference between his own down to earth style and sappho more celestial qualities when he describes her almost as goddess as cited above and yet it has been argued that both poets were concerned with balance between the divine and the profane each emphasising different elements in that balance dionysius of halicarnassus exhorts us to observe in alcaeus the sublimity brevity and sweetness coupled with stern power his splendid figures and his clearness which was unimpaired by the dialect and above all mark his manner of expressing his sentiments on public affairs while quintilian after commending alcaeus for his excellence in that part of his works where he inveighs against tyrants and contributes to good morals in his language he is concise exalted careful and often like an orator goes on to add but he descended into wantonness and amours though better fitted for higher things poetic genres the works of alcaeus are conventionally grouped according to five genres political songs alcaeus often composed on political theme covering the power struggles on lesbos with the passion and vigour of partisan cursing his opponents rejoicing in their deaths delivering blood curdling homilies on the consequences of political inaction and exhorting his comrades to heroic defiance as in one of his ship of state allegories commenting on alcaeus as political poet the scholar dionysius of halicarnassus once observed that if you removed the meter you would find political rhetoric drinking songs according to the grammarian athenaeus alcaeus made every occasion an excuse for drinking and he has provided posterity several quotes in proof of it alcaeus exhorts his friends to drink in celebration of tyrant death to drink away their sorrows to drink because life is short and along the lines in vino veritas to drink through winter storms and to drink through the heat of summer the latter poem in fact paraphrases verses from hesiod re casting them in asclepiad meter and aeolian dialect hymns alcaeus sang about the gods in the spirit of the homeric hymns to entertain his companions rather than to glorify the gods and in the same meters that he used for his secular lyrics there are for example fragments in sapphic meter praising the dioscuri hermes and the river hebrus river significant in lesbian mythology since it was down its waters that the head of orpheus was believed to have floated singing eventually crossing the sea to lesbos and ending up in temple of apollo as symbol of lesbian supremacy in song according to porphyrion the hymn to hermes was imitated by horace in one of his own sapphic odes mercuri facunde nepos atlantis love songs almost all alcaeus amorous verses mentioned with disapproval by quintilian above have vanished without trace there is brief reference to his love poetry in passage by cicero horace who often wrote in imitation of alcaeus sketches in verse one of the lesbian poet favourite subjects lycus of the black hair and eyes nigris oculis nigroque crine decorum it is possible that alcaeus wrote amorously about sappho as indicated in an earlier quote miscellaneous alcaeus wrote on such wide variety of subjects and themes that contradictions in his character emerge the grammarian athenaeus quoted some verses about perfumed ointments to prove just how unwarlike alcaeus could be and he quoted his description of the armour adorning the walls of his house as proof that he could be unusually warlike for lyric poet other examples of his readiness for both warlike and unwarlike subjects are lyrics celebrating his brother heroic exploits as babylonian mercenary and lyrics sung in rare meter sapphic ionic in minore in the voice of distressed girl wretched me who share in all ills possibly imitated by horace in an ode in the same meter miserarum est neque amori dare ludum neque dulci he also wrote sapphic stanzas on homeric themes but in unhomeric style comparing helen of troy unfavourably with thetis the mother of akhilles drinking poem fr the following verses demonstrate some key characteristics of the alcaic style square brackets indicate uncertainties in the ancient text the greek meter here is relatively simple comprising the greater asclepiad adroitly used to convey for example the rhythm of jostling cups the language of the poem is typically direct and concise and comprises short sentences the first line is in fact model of condensed meaning comprising an exhortation let drink rhetorical question why are we waiting for the lamps and justifying statement only an inch of daylight left the meaning is clear and uncomplicated the subject is drawn from personal experience and there is an absence of poetic ornament such as simile or metaphor like many of his poems frs it begins with verb in this case let drink and it includes proverbial expression only an inch of daylight left though it is possible that he coined it himself hymn fr alcaeus rarely used metaphor or simile and yet he had fondness for the allegory of the storm tossed ship of state the following fragment of hymn to castor and polydeuces the dioscuri is possibly another example of this though some scholars interpret it instead as prayer for safe voyage hither now to me from your isle of pelops you powerful children of zeus and leda showing youselves kindly by nature castor and polydeuces travelling abroad on swift footed horses over the wide earth over all the ocean how easily you bring deliverance from death gelid rigor landing on tall ships with sudden great bound far away light up the forestays running bringing radiance to ship in trouble sailed in the darkness the poem was written in sapphic stanzas verse form popularly associated with his compatriot sappho but in which he too excelled here paraphrased in english to suggest the same rhythms there were probably another three stanzas in the original poem but only nine letters of them remain the far away light is reference to st elmo fire an electrical discharge supposed by ancient greek mariners to be an epiphany of the dioscuri but the meaning of the line was obscured by gaps in the papyrus until reconstructed by modern scholar such reconstructions are typical of the extant poetry see scholars fragments and sources below this poem doesn begin with verb but with an adverb δευτέ but still communicates sense of action he probably performed his verses at drinking parties for friends and political allies men for whom loyalty was essential particularly in such troubled times tributes from other poets horace the roman poet horace modelled his own lyrical compositions on those of alcaeus rendering the lesbian poet verse forms including alcaic and sapphic stanzas into concise latin an achievement he celebrates in his third book of odes in his second book in an ode composed in alcaic stanzas on the subject of an almost fatal accident he had on his farm he imagines meeting alcaeus and sappho in hades ovid ovid compared alcaeus to sappho in letters of the heroines where sappho is imagined to speak as follows scholars fragments and sources nd century ad papyrus of alcaeus one of the many such fragments that have contributed to our greatly improved knowledge of alcaeus poetry during the th century berol inv fr the story of alcaeus is partly the story of the scholars who rescued his work from oblivion his verses have not come down to us through manuscript tradition generations of scribes copying an author collected works such as delivered intact into the modern age four entire books of pindar odes but haphazardly in quotes from ancient scholars and commentators whose own works have chanced to survive and in the tattered remnants of papyri uncovered from an ancient rubbish pile at oxyrhynchus and other locations in egypt sources that modern scholars have studied and correlated exhaustively adding little by little to the world store of poetic fragments ancient scholars quoted alcaeus in support of various arguments thus for example heraclitus the allegorist quoted fr and part of fr about ships in storm in his study on homer use of allegory the hymn to hermes fr was quoted by hephaestion grammarian and both he and libanius the rhetorician quoted the first two lines of fr celebrating the return from babylon of alcaeus brother the rest of fr was paraphrased in prose by the historian geographer strabo many fragments were supplied in quotes by athenaeus principally on the subject of wine drinking but fr wine window into man was quoted much later by the byzantine grammarian john tzetzes the first modern publication of alcaeus verses appeared in greek and latin edition of fragments collected from the canonic nine lyrical poets by michael neander published at basle in this was followed by another edition of the nine poets collected by henricus stephanus and published in paris in fulvius ursinus compiled fuller collection of alcaic fragments including commentary which was published at antwerp in the first separate edition of alcaeus was by christian david jani and it was published at halle in the next separate edition was by august matthiae leipzig some of the fragments quoted by ancient scholars were able to be integrated by scholars in the nineteenth century thus for example two separate quotes by athenaeus were united by theodor bergk to form fr three separate sources were combined to form fr as mentioned above including prose paraphrase from strabo that first needed to be restored to its original meter synthesis achieved by the united efforts of otto hoffmann karl otfried muller and franz heinrich ludolf ahrens the discovery of the oxyrhynchus papyri towards the end of the nineteenth century dramatically increased the scope of scholarly research in fact eight important fragments have now been compiled from papyri frs and most recently these fragments typically feature lacunae or gaps that scholars fill with educated guesses including for example brilliant supplement by maurice bowra in fr hymn to the dioscuri that includes description of st elmo fire in the ship rigging working with only eight letters tr pró tr ntes bowra conjured up phrase that brilliantly develops the meaning and the euphony of the poem tr próton ontréchontes describing luminescence running along the forestays references

ealdred or aldred died september was abbot of tavistock bishop of worcester and archbishop of york in anglo saxon england he was related to number of other ecclesiastics of the period after becoming monk at the monastery at winchester he was appointed abbot of tavistock abbey in around in he was named to the bishopric of worcester ealdred besides his episcopal duties served edward the confessor the king of england as diplomat and as military leader he worked to bring one of the king relatives edward the exile back to england from hungary to secure an heir for the childless king in he undertook pilgrimage to jerusalem the first bishop from england to do so as administrator of the diocese of hereford he was involved in fighting against the welsh suffering two defeats at the hands of raiders before securing settlement with gruffydd ap llywelyn welsh ruler in ealdred was elected to the archbishopric of york but had difficulty in obtaining papal approval for his appointment only managing to do so when he promised not to hold the bishoprics of york and worcester simultaneously he helped secure the election of wulfstan as his successor at worcester during his archiepiscopate he built and embellished churches in his diocese and worked to improve his clergy by holding synod which published regulations for the priesthood some sources state that following king edward the confessor death in it was ealdred who crowned harold godwinson as king of england ealdred supported harold as king but when harold was defeated at the battle of hastings ealdred backed edgar the ætheling and then endorsed king william the conqueror the duke of normandy and distant relative of king edward ealdred crowned king william on christmas day in william never quite trusted ealdred or the other english leaders and ealdred had to accompany william back to normandy in but he had returned to york by the time of his death in ealdred supported the churches and monasteries in his diocese with gifts and building projects early life ealdred was probably born in the west of england and could be related to lyfing his predecessor as bishop of worcester his family from devonshire may have been well to do another relative was wilstan or wulfstan who under ealdred influence became abbot of gloucester ealdred was monk in the cathedral chapter at winchester cathedral before becoming abbot of tavistock abbey about an office he held until about even after leaving the abbacy of tavistock he continued to hold two properties from the abbey until his death no contemporary documents relating to ealdred time as abbot have been discovered ealdred was made bishop of worcester in position he held until his resignation in he may have acted as suffragan or subordinate bishop to his predecessor lyfing before formally assuming the bishopric as from about ealdred witnessed as an episcopus or bishop and charter from or early names sihtric as abbot of tavistock lyfing died on march and ealdred became bishop of worcester shortly after however ealdred did not receive the other two dioceses that lyfing had held crediton and cornwall king edward the confessor reigned granted these to leofric who combined the two sees at crediton in bishop and royal advisor harold godwinson from the alt tapestry image of man on horseback holding falcon ealdred was an advisor to king edward the confessor and was often involved in the royal government he was also military leader and in he led an unsuccessful expedition against the welsh this was in retaliation for raid led by the welsh rulers gruffydd ap rhydderch rhys ap rhydderch and gruffydd ap llywelyn ealdred expedition was betrayed by some welsh soldiers who were serving with the english and ealdred was defeated in ealdred went to rome on the king errand apparently to secure papal approval to move the seat or centre of the bishopric of crediton to exeter it may also have been to secure the release of the king from vow to go on pilgrimage if sources from after the norman conquest of england are to be believed while in rome he attended papal council along with his fellow english bishop herman that same year as ealdred was returning to england he met sweyn son of godwin earl of wessex and probably absolved sweyn for having abducted the abbess of leominster abbey in through ealdred intercession sweyn was restored to his earldom which he had lost after abducting the abbess and murdering his cousin beorn estrithson ealdred helped sweyn not only because ealdred was supporter of earl godwin family but because sweyn earldom was close to his bishopric as recently as irish raiders had allied with gruffydd ap rhydderch of gwent in raiding along the river usk ealdred unsuccessfully tried to drive off the raiders but was again routed by the welsh this failure underscored ealdred need for strong earl in the area to protect against raids normally the bishop of hereford would have led the defence in the absence of an earl of hereford but in the incumbent æthelstan was blind so ealdred took on the role of defender diplomatic travels earl godwin rebellion against the king in came as blow to ealdred who was supporter of the earl and his family ealdred was present at the royal council at london that banished godwin family later in when he was sent to intercept harold godwinson and his brothers as they fled england after their father outlawing ealdred could not or would not capture the brothers the banishment of ealdred patron came shortly after the death of ælfric puttoc the archbishop of york york and worcester had long had close ties and the two sees had often been held in plurality or at the same time ealdred probably wanted to become archbishop of york after ælfric death but his patron eclipse led to the king appointing cynesige royal chaplain instead in september though godwin returned from exile and his family was restored to power by late ealdred was once more in royal favour at some point he was alleged to have accompanied swein on pilgrimage to the holy land but proof is lacking in king edward sent ealdred to germany to obtain emperor henry iii help in returning edward the exile son of edmund ironside to england edmund reigned was an elder half brother of king edward the confessor and edmund son edward was in hungary with king andrew having left england as an infant after his father death and the accession of cnut as king of england in this mission ealdred was somewhat successful and obtained insight into the working of the german church during stay of year with hermann ii the archbishop of cologne he also was impressed with the buildings he saw and later incorporated some of the german styles into his own constructions the main objective of the mission however was to secure the return of edward but this failed mainly because henry iii relations with the hungarians were strained and the emperor was unable or unwilling to help ealdred ealdred was able to discover that edward was alive and had place at the hungarian court although some sources state that ealdred attended the coronation of emperor henry iv this is not possible as on the date that henry was crowned ealdred was in england consecrating an abbot ealdred had returned to england by and brought with him copy of the pontificale romano germanicum set of liturgies with him an extant copy of this work currently manuscript cotton vitellus xii has been identified as copy owned by ealdred it appears likely that the rule of chrodegang continental set of ordinances for the communal life of secular canons was introduced into england by ealdred sometime before probably he brought it back from germany possibly in concert with harold after ealdred return to england he took charge of the sees of hereford and ramsbury ealdred also administered winchcombe abbey and gloucester abbey the authors of the handbook of british chronology third edition say he was named bishop of hereford in holding the see until he resigned it in but other sources say that he merely administered the see while it was vacant or that he was bishop of hereford from to ealdred became involved with the see of ramsbury after its bishop herman got into dispute with king edward over the movement of the seat of his bishopric to malmesbury abbey herman wished to move the seat of his see but edward refused permission for the move ealdred was close associate of herman and the historian loyn called herman something of an alter ego to ealdred according to the medieval chronicler john of worcester ealdred was given the see of ramsbury to administer while herman remained outside england herman returned in and resumed his bishopric there is no contemporary documentary evidence of ealdred administration of ramsbury welsh affairs jerusalem and worcester the king again employed ealdred as diplomat in when he assisted earls harold and leofric in negotiations with the welsh edward sent ealdred after the death in battle of bishop leofgar of hereford who had attacked gruffydd ap llywelyn after encouragement from the king however leofgar lost the battle and his life and edward had to sue for peace although details of the negotiations are lacking gruffydd ap llywelyn swore loyalty to king edward but the oath may not have had any obligations on gruffydd part to edward the exact terms of the submission are not known in total but gruffydd was not required to assist edward in war nor attend edward court ealdred was rewarded with the administration of the see of hereford which he held until and was appointed archbishop of york the diocese had suffered serious raid from the welsh in and during his administration ealdred continued the rebuilding of the cathedral church as well as securing the cathedral chapter rights ealdred was granted the administration in order that the area might have someone with experience with the welsh in charge in ealdred made pilgrimage to jerusalem the first english bishop to make the journey he travelled through hungary and the anglo saxon chronicle stated that he went to jerusalem in such state as no one had done before him while in jerusalem he made gift of gold chalice to the church of the holy sepulchre it is possible that the reason ealdred travelled through hungary was to arrange the travel of edward the exile family to england another possibility is that he wished to search for other possible heirs to king edward in hungary it is not known exactly when edward the exile family returned to england whether they returned with edward in or sometime later so it is only possibility that they returned with ealdred in very little documentary evidence is available from ealdred time as bishop of worcester only five leases that he signed survive and all date from to two further leases exist in hemming cartulary as copies only how the diocese of worcester was administered when ealdred was abroad is unclear although it appears that wulfstan the prior of the cathedral chapter performed the religious duties in the diocese on the financial side the evesham chronicle states that æthelwig who became abbot of evesham abbey in administered worcester before he became abbot archbishop of york the funeral cortege of edward the confessor from the alt tapestry image of procession of men carrying coffin heading towards church building cynesige the archbishop of york died on december and ealdred was elected archbishop of york on christmas day although bishop was promptly appointed to hereford none was named to worcester and it appears that ealdred intended to retain worcester along with york which several of his predecessors had done there were few reasons for this one of which was political as the kings of england preferred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism another reason was that york was not wealthy see and worcester was holding worcester along with york allowed the archbishop sufficient revenue to support himself in ealdred travelled to rome to receive the pallium the symbol of an archbishop authority journeying with him was tostig another son of earl godwin who was now earl of northumbria william of malmesbury says that ealdred by amusing the simplicity of king edward and alleging the custom of his predecessors had acquired more by bribery than by reason the archbishopric of york while still holding his former see on his arrival in rome however charges of simony or the buying of ecclesiastical office and lack of learning were brought against him and his elevation to york was refused by pope nicholas ii who also deposed him from worcester the story of ealdred being deposed comes from the vita edwardi life of edward the confessor but the vita wulfstani an account of the life of ealdred successor at worcester wulfstan says that nicholas refused the pallium until promise to find replacement for worcester was given by ealdred yet another chronicler john of worcester mentions nothing of any trouble in rome and when discussing the appointment of wulfstan says that wulfstan was elected freely and unanimously by the clergy and people john of worcester also claims that at wulfstan consecration stigand the archbishop of canterbury extracted promise from ealdred that neither he nor his successors would lay claim to any jurisdiction over the diocese of worcester given that john of worcester wrote his chronicle after the eruption of the canterbury york supremacy struggle the story of ealdred renouncing any claims to worcester needs to be considered suspect for whatever reason ealdred gave up the see of worcester in when papal legates arrived in england to hold council and make sure that ealdred relinquished worcester this happened at easter in ealdred was succeeded by wulfstan chosen by ealdred but john of worcester relates that ealdred had hard time deciding between wulfstan and æthelwig the legates had urged the selection of wulfstan because of his saintliness because the position of stigand the archbishop of canterbury was irregular wulfstan sought and received consecration as bishop from ealdred normally wulfstan would have gone to the archbishop of canterbury as the see of worcester was within canterbury province although ealdred gave up the bishopric the appointment of wulfstan was one that allowed ealdred to continue his considerable influence on the see of worcester ealdred retained number of estates belonging to worcester even after the norman conquest ealdred still controlled some events in worcester and it was ealdred not wulfstan who opposed urse abetot attempt to extend the castle of worcester into the cathedral after the norman conquest while archbishop ealdred built at beverley expanding on the building projects begun by his predecessor cynesige as well as repairing and expanding other churches in his diocese he also built refectories for the canons at york and southwell he also was the one bishop that published ecclesiastical legislation during edward the confessor reign attempting to discipline and reform the clergy he held synod of his clergy shortly before after the death of edward the confessor alt coin image of crowned male head with sceptre in the background john of worcester medieval chronicler stated that ealdred crowned king harold ii in although the norman chroniclers mention stigand as the officiating prelate given ealdred known support of godwin family john of worcester is probably correct stigand position as archbishop was canonically suspect and as earl harold had not allowed stigand to consecrate one of the earl churches it is unlikely that harold would have allowed stigand to perform the much more important royal coronation arguments for stigand having performed the coronation however rely on the fact that no other english source names the ecclesiastic who performed the ceremony all norman sources name stigand as the presider in all events ealdred and harold were close and ealdred supported harold bid to become king ealdred perhaps accompanied harold when the new king went to york and secured the support of the northern magnates shortly after harold consecration according to the medieval chronicler geoffrey gaimar after the battle of stamford bridge harold entrusted the loot gained from harold hardrada to ealdred gaimar asserts that king harold did this because he had heard of duke william landing in england and needed to rush south to counter it after the battle of hastings ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate edgar the ætheling edward the exile son as king but eventually he submitted to william the conqueror at berkhamsted john of worcester says that the group supporting edgar vacillated over what to do while william ravaged the countryside which led to ealdred and edgar submission to william ealdred crowned william king on christmas day an innovation in william coronation ceremony was that before the actual crowning ealdred asked the assembled crowd in english if it was their wish that william be crowned king the bishop of coutances then did the same but in norman french in march william took ealdred with him when william returned to normandy along with the other english leaders earl edwin of mercia earl morcar edgar the ætheling and archbishop stigand ealdred at whitsun performed the coronation of matilda william wife the laudes regiae or song commending ruler that was performed at matilda coronation may have been composed by ealdred himself for the occasion in when the northern thegns rebelled against william and attempted to install edgar the ætheling as king ealdred continued to support william he was the only northern leader to support william however ealdred was back at york by he died there on september and was buried in his episcopal cathedral he may have taken an active part in trying to calm the rebellions in the north in and the medieval chronicler william of malmesbury records story that when the new sheriff of worcester urse abetot encroached on the cemetery of the cathedral chapter for worcester cathedral ealdred pronounced rhyming curse on him saying thou are called urse may you have god curse legacy after ealdred death one of the restraints on william treatment of the english was removed ealdred was one of few native englishmen who william appears to have trusted and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate englishmen into the administration although such efforts did not entirely stop in church council was held at westminster and number of bishops were deposed by there were only two englishmen in episcopal sees and by the time of william death in there was only one wulfstan ii of worcester ealdred did much to restore discipline in the monasteries and churches under his authority and was liberal with gifts to the churches of his diocese he built the monastic church of st peter at gloucester now gloucester cathedral though nothing of his fabric remains then part of his diocese of worcester he also repaired large part of beverley minster in the diocese of york adding presbytery and an unusually splendid painted ceiling covering all the upper part of the church from the choir to the tower intermingled with gold in various ways and in wonderful fashion he added pulpit in german style of bronze gold and silver surmounted by an arch with rood cross in the same materials these were examples of the lavish decorations added to important churches in the years before the conquest ealdred encouraged folcard monk of canterbury to write the life of saint john of beverley this was part of ealdred promotion of the cult of saint john who had only been canonised in along with the pontificale ealdred may have brought back from cologne the first manuscript of the cambridge songs to enter england collection of latin goliardic songs which became famous in the middle ages the historian michael lapidge suggests that the laudes regiae which are included in cotton vitellius xii might have been composed by ealdred or member of his household another historian cowdrey argued that the laudes were composed at winchester these praise songs are probably the same performed at matilda coronation but might have been used at other court ceremonies before ealdred death historians have seen ealdred as an old fashioned prince bishop others say that he raised the see of york from its former rustic state he was known for his generosity and for his diplomatic and administrative abilities after the conquest ealdred provided degree of continuity between the pre and post conquest worlds one modern historian feels that it was ealdred who was behind the compilation of the version of the anglo saxon chronicle and gives date in the as its composition certainly ealdred is one of the leading figures in the work and it is likely that one of his clerks compiled the

alexander iii was the emperor of russia king of poland and grand duke of finland from until his death on he was highly conservative and reversed some of the liberal reforms of his father alexander ii during alexander reign russia fought no major wars for which he was styled the peacemaker early life disposition alexander iii as tsesarevich by sergei lvovich levitsky grand duke alexander alexandrovich was born on march at the winter palace in saint petersburg russian empire the second son and third child of emperor alexander ii of russia and his first wife marie of hesse in disposition alexander bore little resemblance to his soft hearted liberal father and still less to his refined philosophic sentimental chivalrous yet cunning great uncle emperor alexander of russia who could have been given the title of the first gentleman of europe although an enthusiastic amateur musician and patron of the ballet alexander was seen as lacking refinement and elegance indeed he rather relished the idea of being of the same rough texture as some of his subjects his straightforward abrupt manner savoured sometimes of gruffness while his direct unadorned method of expressing himself harmonized well with his rough hewn immobile features and somewhat sluggish movements his education was not such as to soften these peculiarities more than six feet tall about he was also noted for his immense physical strength sebaceous cyst on the left side of his nose caused him to be mocked by some of his contemporaries and he sat for photographs and portraits with the right side of his face most prominent an account from the memoirs of the artist alexander benois gives one impression of alexander iii after performance of the ballet tsar kandavl at the mariinsky theatre first caught sight of the emperor was struck by the size of the man and although cumbersome and heavy he was still mighty figure there was indeed something of the muzhik russian peasant about him the look of his bright eyes made quite an impression on me as he passed where was standing he raised his head for second and to this day can remember what felt as our eyes met it was look as cold as steel in which there was something threatening even frightening and it struck me like blow the tsar gaze the look of man who stood above all others but who carried monstrous burden and who every minute had to fear for his life and the lives of those closest to him in later years came into contact with the emperor on several occasions and felt not the slightest bit timid in more ordinary cases tsar alexander iii could be at once kind simple and even almost homely education though he was destined to be strongly counter reforming emperor alexander had little prospect of succeeding to the throne during the first two decades of his life as he had an elder brother nicholas who seemed of robust constitution even when nicholas first displayed symptoms of delicate health the notion that he might die young was never taken seriously and he was betrothed to princess dagmar of denmark daughter of king christian ix of denmark and queen louise of denmark and whose siblings included king frederick viii of denmark alexandra queen of the united kingdom and king george of greece great solicitude was devoted to the education of nicholas as tsesarevich whereas alexander received only the training of an ordinary grand duke of that period this included acquaintance with french english and german and military drill as tsesarevich grand painting by the artist georges becker of the coronation of tsar alexander iii and empress maria fyodorovna which took place on at the uspensky sobor of the moscow kremlin on the left of the dais can be seen his young son and heir the tsesarevich nicholas and behind nicholas can be seen young grand duke george alexander became tsesarevich upon nicholas sudden death in it was then that he began to study the principles of law and administration under konstantin pobedonostsev then professor of civil law at moscow state university and later from chief procurator of the holy synod of the orthodox church in russia pobedonostsev instilled into the young man mind the belief that zeal for russian orthodox thought was an essential factor of russian patriotism to be cultivated by every right minded emperor while he was heir apparent from to alexander did not play prominent part in public affairs but allowed it to become known that he had ideas which did not coincide with the principles of the existing government on his deathbed the previous tsesarevich was said to have expressed the wish that his fiancée princess dagmar of denmark should marry his successor this wish was swiftly realized when on in the grand church of the winter palace in st petersburg alexander wed dagmar who converted to orthodox christianity and took the name maria feodorovna the union proved happy one to the end unlike his father there was no adultery in his marriage the couple spent their wedding night at the tsesarevich private dacha known as my property later on the tsesarevich became estranged from his father this was due to their vastly differing political views as well was his resentment towards alexander ii long standing relationship with catherine dolgorukov with whom he had several illegitimate children while his mother the empress was suffering from chronic ill health to the scandal of many at court including the tsesarevich himself alexander ii married catherine mere month after marie alexandrovna death in reign on march alexander father alexander ii was assassinated by members of the terrorist organization narodnaya volya as result he ascended to the russian imperial throne in nennal on march he and maria feodorovna were officially crowned and anointed at the assumption cathedral in moscow on may domestic policies on the day of his assassination alexander ii had signed an ukaz setting up consultative commissions to advise the monarch on ascending to the throne however alexander iii took pobedonostsev advice and canceled the policy before its publication he made it clear that his autocracy would not be limited empress maria fyodorovna on holiday in copenhagen in alexander receiving rural district elders in the yard of petrovsky palace in moscow by ilya repin all of alexander iii internal reforms aimed to reverse the liberalization that had occurred in his father reign the new emperor believed that remaining true to russian orthodoxy autocracy and nationality the ideology introduced by his grandfather emperor nicholas would save russia from revolutionary agitation alexander political ideal was nation composed of single nationality language and religion as well as one form of administration he attempted to realize this by the institution of mandatory teaching of the russian language throughout the empire including to his german polish and other non russian subjects with the exception of the finns by the patronization of eastern orthodoxy by the destruction of the remnants of german polish and swedish institutions in the respective provinces and by the weakening of judaism through persecution of the jews the latter policy was implemented in the may laws of which banned jews from inhabiting rural areas and shtetls even within the pale of settlement and restricted the occupations in which they could engage alexander weakened the power of the zemstvo elective local administrative bodies resembling british parish councils and placed the administration of peasant communes under the supervision of land owning proprietors appointed by his government these land captains zemskiye nachalniki were feared and resented throughout the empire peasant communities these acts weakened the nobility and the peasantry and brought imperial administration under the emperor personal control in such policies alexander iii had the encouragement of konstantin pobedonostsev who retained control of the church in russia through his long tenure as procurator of the holy synod from to and who became tutor to alexander son and heir nicholas pobedonostsev appears as toporov in tolstoy novel resurrection other conservative advisors included count tolstoy minister of education and later of internal affairs and durnovo tolstoy successor in the latter post mikhail katkov and other journalists supported the emperor in his autocracy encouraged by its successful assassination of alexander ii the narodnaya volya movement began planning the murder of alexander iii the okhrana uncovered the plot and five of the conspirators including alexander ulyanov the older brother of vladimir lenin were captured and hanged on the famine of and the ensuing cholera epidemic permitted some liberal activity as the russian government could not cope with the crisis and had to allow zemstvos to help with relief among others tolstoy helped organize soup kitchens and chekhov directed anti cholera precautions in several villages the borki cathedral was one of many churches built all over the empire to commemorate the tsar miraculous survival in the train crash foreign policy in foreign affairs alexander iii was man of peace but not at any price and held that the best means of averting war is to be well prepared for it though he was indignant at the conduct of german chancellor otto von bismarck towards russia he avoided an open rupture with germany even reviving the league of three emperors for period of time and in signed the reinsurance treaty with the germans however in the expiration of the treaty coincided with the dismissal of bismarck by the new german emperor kaiser wilhelm ii for whom the tsar had an immense dislike and the unwillingness of wilhelm ii government to renew the treaty in response alexander iii then began cordial relations with france eventually entering into an alliance with the french in ruble coin of alexander iii despite chilly relations with berlin the tsar nevertheless confined himself to keeping large number of troops near the german frontier with regard to bulgaria he exercised similar self control the efforts of prince alexander and afterwards of stambolov to destroy russian influence in the principality roused his indignation but he vetoed all proposals to intervene by force of arms in central asian affairs he followed the traditional policy of gradually extending russian domination without provoking conflict with the united kingdom see panjdeh incident and he never allowed the bellicose partisans of forward policy to get out of hand his reign cannot be regarded as an eventful period of russian history but under his hard rule the country made considerable progress alexander and his wife regularly spent their summers at langinkoski manor near kotka on the finnish coast where their children were immersed in scandinavian lifestyle of relative modesty alexander deprecated foreign influence german influence in particular thus the adoption of local national principles was off in all spheres of official activity with view to realizing his ideal of russia homogeneous in language administration and religion these ideas conflicted with those of his father who had german sympathies despite being patriot alexander ii often used the german language in his private relations occasionally ridiculed the slavophiles and based his foreign policy on the prussian alliance equestrian statue of alexander iii by prince paolo troubetzkoy shows the emperor sitting heavily on the back of ponderous horse some differences had first appeared during the franco prussian war when alexander ii supported the cabinet of berlin while the tsesarevich made no effort to conceal his sympathies for the french these sentiments would resurface during when the eastern question excited russian society at first the tsesarevich was more slavophile than the government but his phlegmatic nature restrained him from many exaggerations and any popular illusions he may have imbibed were dispelled by personal observation in bulgaria where he commanded the left wing of the invading army never consulted on political questions alexander confined himself to military duties and fulfilled them in conscientious and unobtrusive manner after many mistakes and disappointments the army reached constantinople and the treaty of san stefano was signed but much that had been obtained by that important document had to be sacrificed at the congress of berlin bismarck failed to do what was expected of him by the russian emperor in return for the russian support which had enabled him to create the german empire it was thought that he would help russia to solve the eastern question in accordance with russian interests but to the surprise and indignation of the cabinet of saint petersburg he confined himself to acting the part of honest broker at the congress and shortly afterwards contracted an alliance with austria hungary for the purpose of counteracting russian designs in eastern europe the tsesarevich could refer to these results as confirmation of the views he had expressed during the franco prussian war he concluded that for russia the best thing was to recover as quickly as possible from her temporary exhaustion and prepare for future contingencies by military and naval reorganization in accordance with this conviction he suggested that certain reforms should be introduced family life george of the united kingdom marie feodorovna maria of greece tsesarevich nicholas later emperor nicholas ii of russia probably taken on the imperial yacht near denmark following his father assassination alexander iii was advised that it would be difficult for him to be kept safe at the winter palace as result alexander relocated his family to the gatchina palace located twenty miles south of st petersburg making it his primary residence under heavy guard he would make occasional visits into st petersburg but even then he would stay in the anichkov palace as opposed to the winter palace in the alexander fell madly in love with his mother lady in waiting princess maria elimovna meshcherskaya dismayed to learn that prince wittgenstein had proposed to her in spring he told his parents that he was prepared to give up his rights of succession in order to marry his beloved dusenka on may alexander ii informed his son that russia had come to an agreement with the parents of princess dagmar of denmark his fourth cousin before then she had been the fiancée of his late elder brother nicholas at first alexander refused to travel to copenhagen declaring that he did not love dagmar and his desire to marry maria in response the enraged emperor ordered alexander to go straight to denmark and propose to princess dagmar the tsesarevich then realised that he was not free man and that duty had to come first and foremost the only thing left to do was to write in his diary farewell dear dusenka maria was forced to leave russia accompanied by her aunt princess chernyshova almost year after her first appearance in paris pavel pavlovich demidov nd prince di san donato fell in love with her and the couple married in maria would die giving birth to her son elim pavlovich demidov rd prince di san donato alexander reaction to the news of her death and the birth of her child is unknown alexander soon grew fond of dagmar and had six children by her five of whom survived into adulthood nicholas george xenia michael and olga of his five surviving children he was closest to his youngest two each summer his parents in law king christian ix and queen louise held family reunions at the danish royal palaces of fredensborg and bernstorff bringing alexander maria and their children to denmark his sister in law the princess of wales would come from great britain with some of her children and his brother in law king george of greece his wife queen olga who was first cousin of alexander and romanov grand duchess by birth came with their children from athens in contrast to the strict security observed in russia alexander and maria revelled in the relative freedom that they enjoyed in denmark alexander once commenting to the prince and princess of wales near the end of visit that he envied them being able to return to happy home in england while he was returning to his russian prison in denmark he was able to enjoy joining his children in muddy ponds looking for tadpoles sneaking into his father in law orchard to steal apples and playing pranks such as turning water hose on the visiting king oscar ii of sweden as tsesarevich and then as tsar alexander had an extremely poor relationship with his brother grand duke vladimir this tension was reflected in the rivalry between maria feodorovna and vladimir wife grand duchess marie pavlovna alexander had better relationships with his other brothers alexei whom he made rear admiral and then grand admiral of the russian navy sergei whom he made governor of moscow and paul despite the antipathy that alexander had towards his stepmother princess catherine dolgorukov he nevertheless allowed her to remain in the winter palace for some time after his father assassination and to retain various keepsakes of him these included alexander ii blood soaked uniform that he died wearing and his reading glasses on the imperial train derailed in an accident at borki at the moment of the crash the imperial family was in the dining car its roof collapsed and alexander supposedly held its remains on his shoulders as the children fled outdoors the onset of alexander kidney failure was later attributed to the blunt trauma suffered in this incident illness and death in alexander iii became ill with terminal kidney disease nephritis in the fall of that year maria fyodorovna sister in law queen olga of greece offered her villa of mon repos on the island of corfu in the hope that it might improve the tsar condition however by the time that they reached crimea they stayed at the maly palace in livadia as alexander was too weak to travel any further recognizing that the tsar days were numbered various imperial relatives began to descend on livadia even the famed clergyman john of kronstadt paid visit and administered communion to the tsar on october alexander received nicholas fiancée princess alix who had come from her native darmstadt to receive the tsar blessing despite being exceedingly weak alexander insisted on receiving alix in full dress uniform an event that left him exhausted soon after his health began to deteriorate more rapidly he eventually died in the arms of his wife and in the presence of his physician ernst viktor von leyden at maly palace in livadia on the afternoon of at the age of forty nine and was succeeded by his eldest son tsesarevich nicholas who took the throne as nicholas ii after leaving livadia on november and traveling to st

quite controversial at the time with many including the members of the imperial family opposed to the design but it was approved because of the empress dowager unexpectedly liking the monument

alexios doukas alexios doukas mourtzouphlos or alexius ducas december was the byzantine emperor from february to april during the second and final siege of constantinople by the participants of the fourth crusade his family name was doukas his other surname was descriptive nickname mourtzouphlos or murtzuphlus referring to either bushy overhanging eyebrows or sullen gloomy character he achieved power through palace coup killing his predecessors in the process though he made vigorous attempts to defend constantinople from the crusader army his military efforts proved ineffective his actions won the support of the mass of populace but he alienated the elite of the city he was the last byzantine emperor to rule in constantinople which was sacked despoiled and occupied until the byzantine recovery of the city in after the fall of constantinople alexios was blinded by another ex emperor and later executed by the new latin regime in the city origins and character though possessing the name of leading byzantine aristocratic family there is very little definitely known concerning the ancestry of alexios doukas mourtzouphlos the noble doukas clan were not the only doukai as the surname was also employed by many families of humble origins it has been claimed that alexios doukas was great great grandson of the emperor alexios komnenos in the female line this is not improbable as all other byzantine emperors and the majority of attempted usurpers of the period had connection with the former imperial house of the komnenoi either by descent or marriage more precise theory has been proposed that he was the son of an isaac doukas and was the second cousin of alexios iv angelos letter sent to pope innocent iii stated that alexios doukas mourtzouphlos was blood relation of alexios iv angelos the contemporary historian niketas choniates was dismissed from office as logothete of the sekreta by mourtzouphlos his assessment of the emperor character might therefore be biased however choniates allows that he was extremely clever by nature though arrogant in his manner and lecherous political intrigues and usurpation the participation of alexios doukas mourtzouphlos in the attempted overthrow of alexios iii angelos by john komnenos the fat in had led to his imprisonment mourtzouphlos was probably imprisoned from until the restoration to the throne of isaac ii angelos isaac ii along with his son alexios iv angelos were restored to the throne through the intervention of the leaders of the fourth crusade in july on release mourtzouphlos was invested with the court position of protovestiarios he had been married twice but was allegedly the lover of eudokia angelina daughter of emperor alexios iii angelos by the beginning of isaac ii and alexios iv had inspired little confidence among the people of constantinople in their efforts to defend the city from the latin crusaders and venetians who were restless the westerners rioted and set fires in the city when the money and aid promised by alexios iv was not forthcoming alexios doukas mourtzouphlos emerged as leader of the anti latin movement he won the approval of the populace by his valour in leading an attack on the latins at trypetos lithos in this clash his mount stumbled and he would have been killed or captured had band of youthful archers from the city not defended him the populace rebelled in late january and in the chaos an otherwise obscure nobleman named nicholas kanabos was acclaimed emperor though he was unwilling to accept the crown the two co emperors barricaded themselves in the palace and entrusted mourtzouphlos with mission to seek help from the crusaders or at least they informed him of their intentions instead of contacting the crusaders mourtzouphlos on the night of january used his access to the palace to bribe the ax bearers the varangian guard and with their backing arrest the emperors choniates states that mourtzouphlos when bribing the palace guards had the help of eunuch with access to the imperial treasury the support of the palace guards seems to have been of major importance in the success of the coup though mourtzouphlos also had help from his relations and associates the young alexios iv was eventually strangled in prison while his father isaac both enfeebled and blind died at around the time of the coup his death variously attributed to fright sorrow or mistreatment kanabos after refusing to take office under alexios took sanctuary in hagia sofia but was extracted and killed emperor alexios negotiating with doge enrico dandalo by gustave doré the timing of the deaths of the deposed emperors and of kanabos and their relation to the coronation of alexios are problematic alexios appears to have been acclaimed emperor as early as the night he moved against the angeloi co emperors hendrickx and matzukis suggest that alexios assumed the imperial insignia immediately but was crowned later possibly on february finding the treasury empty the new emperor confiscated money from the aristocracy and high officials to be put to public use these actions endeared alexios to the citizens but alienated his relations and other prominent supporters once in firm control alexios closed the gates of the city to the crusaders and strengthened the defending fortifications sword in hand he was active in leading attacks on sorties made by the crusaders in search of supplies on february henry of flanders led part of the crusader army to filea or phileas in order to obtain food supplies as he returned towards constantinople alexios attacked his rearguard the byzantines were defeated and the imperial standard and an important icon of the virgin were captured the byzantines lost some of their best soldiers in the clash and alexios was lucky to escape alive at about this time alexios attempted to destroy the crusader fleet with fire ships but to little effect on february alexios met the crusader leader enrico dandolo for peace talks the conditions demanded by the venetian doge however were too harsh for the byzantines to consider choniates states that the meeting was brought to close by an sudden attack by crusader cavalry on alexios and his entourage the emperor narrowly escaping capture according to choniates alexios iv was killed the same day the insistence by the crusaders that he be restored to the throne may have precipitated his death when news of the death of alexios iv reached the crusaders relations between them and alexios deteriorated further the forcible expulsion of all latins resident in constantinople in march seems to have been the tipping point which led the crusaders to begin actively negotiating amongst themselves about the partition of the byzantine empire they also began to prepare for their final assault on the city which took place the following month the fall of constantinople flight and death the defenders of constantinople held out against the crusader assault of april the crusaders second attack however proved too strong to repel having broken through the walls near the petria gate the crusaders entered the city and looted the blachernai palace alexios attempted to rally the people to the defence of the city but with no success alexios then boarded fishing boat and fled the city towards thrace on the night of april accompanied by eudokia angelina and her mother euphrosyne doukaina kamatera in hagia sophia constantine laskaris was acclaimed as emperor but being unable to persuade the varangians to continue the fight in the early hours of april he also fled leaving constantinople under crusader control alexios and his companions eventually reached mosynopolis which had been occupied by the deposed emperor alexios iii angelos and his followers at first they were well received with alexios marrying eudokia angelina later however alexios iii arranged for his new son in law to be made captive and blinded thereby rendering him ineligible for the imperial throne having been abandoned by both his supporters and his father in law alexios was captured near mosynopolis or possibly in anatolia by the advancing latins under thierry de loos in november on his return to constantinople as prisoner alexios was tried for treason against alexios iv in his trial the blind ex emperor argued that it was alexios iv who had committed treason to his country through his intention to invite the crusaders to enter constantinople in force on being condemned he was executed by novel means he was thrown to his death from the top of the column of theodosius the new alien latin regime of conquerors in constantinople may have viewed the public trial and execution of the man who murdered the last legitimate emperor as way to cast an aura of legitimacy on themselves alexios was the last byzantine emperor to reign in constantinople before the establishment of the latin empire which controlled the city for the next years

alexei petrovich romanov february july was russian tsarevich he was born in moscow the son of tsar peter and his first wife eudoxia lopukhina childhood the young alexei was brought up by his mother who fostered an atmosphere of disdain towards peter the great alexei father alexei relations with his father suffered from the hatred between his father and his mother as it was very difficult for him to feel affection for his mother worst persecutor from the ages of to alexei was educated by his tutor vyazemsky but after the removal of his mother by peter the great to the suzdal intercession convent alexei was confined to the care of educated foreigners who taught him history geography mathematics and french military career in alexei was ordered to follow the army to the field as private in bombardier regiment in he was present at the capture of narva at this period the preceptors of the tsarevich had the highest opinion of his ability alexei had strong leanings towards archaeology and ecclesiology however peter had wished his son and heir to dedicate himself to the service of new russia and demanded from him unceasing labour in order to maintain russia new wealth and power painful relations between father and son quite apart from the prior personal antipathies were therefore inevitable it was an additional misfortune for alexei that his father should have been too busy to attend to him just as he was growing up from boyhood to manhood he was left in the hands of reactionary boyars and priests who encouraged him to hate his father and wish for the death of the tsar grand duchess charlotte of russia in peter sent alexei to smolensk to collect provender and recruits and after that to moscow to fortify it against charles xii of sweden at the end of alexei went to dresden for one year there he finished lessons in french german mathematics and fortification after his education alexei married princess charlotte of brunswick wolfenbüttel whose family was connected by marriage to many of the great families of europe charlotte sister elizabeth was married to holy roman emperor charles vi ruler of the habsburg monarchy he met with princess charlotte both were pleased with each other and the marriage went forward in theory alexei could have refused the marriage and he had been encouraged by his father to at least meet his intended why haven you written to tell me what you thought about her wrote peter in tone that can only be guessed in letter dated august the marriage contract was signed in september the wedding was celebrated at torgau germany on october one of the terms of the marriage contract agreed to by alexei was that while any forthcoming children were to be raised in the orthodox faith charlotte herself was allowed to retain her protestant faith an agreement opposed by alexei followers as for the marriage itself the first months went well but quickly became failure within months alexis was drunk constantly and alexei pronounced his bride pock marked and too thin he insisted on separate apartments and ignored her in public three weeks later the bridegroom was hurried away by his father to toruń to superintend the provisioning of the russian troops in poland for the next twelve months alexei was kept constantly on the move his wife joined him at toruń in december but in april peremptory ukase ordered him off to the army in pomerania and in the autumn of the same year he was forced to accompany his father on tour of inspection through finland alexis in he had two children with charlotte natalia alexeievna romanova march november peter alexeyevich romanov october january peter alexeyevich would succeed as the emperor peter ii in with his death in the direct male line of the house of romanov became extinct after the birth of natalia in alexei brought his long time finnish serf mistress afrosinia to live in the palace some historians speculate that it was his conservative powerbase disapproval of his foreign non orthodox bride more so than her appearance that caused alexei to spurn charlotte another influence was alexander kikin high placed official who had fallen out with the tsar and had been deprived of his estates flight immediately on his return from finland alexei was dispatched by his father to staraya russa and lake ladoga to see to the building of new ships this was the last commission entrusted to him since peter had not been satisfied with his son performance and his lack of enthusiasm nevertheless peter made one last effort to reclaim his son on october charlotte died after giving birth to son the grand duke peter the future emperor peter ii on the day of the funeral peter sent alexei stern letter urging him to take interest in the affairs of the state peter threatened to cut him off if he did not acquiesce in his father plans alexei wrote pitiful reply to his father offering to renounce the succession in favour of his infant son peter peter would agree but on the condition that alexei remove himself as dynastic threat and become monk while alexei was pondering his options on august peter wrote to alexei from abroad urging him if he desired to remain tsarevich to join him and the army without delay rather than face this ordeal alexei fled to vienna and placed himself under the protection of his brother in law the emperor charles vi who sent him for safety first to the tirolean fortress of ehrenberg near reutte and finally to the castle of sant elmo at naples he was accompanied throughout his journey by afrosinia that the emperor sincerely sympathized with alexei and suspected peter of harbouring murderous designs against his son is plain from his confidential letter to george of great britain whom he consulted on this delicate affair peter felt insulted the flight of the tsarevich to foreign potentate was reproach and scandal and he had to be recovered and brought back to russia at all costs this difficult task was accomplished by count peter tolstoi the most subtle and unscrupulous of peter servants peter interrogates tsarevich alexei petrovich at peterhof history painting by nikolai ge tretyakov gallery moscow return alexei would only consent to return on his father solemnly swearing that if he came back he should not be punished in the least but cherished as son and allowed to live quietly on his estates and marry afrosinia on january the tsarevich reached moscow peter had already determined to institute searching inquisition in order to get at the bottom of the mystery of the flight on february confession was extorted from alexei which implicated most of his friends and he then publicly renounced the succession to the throne in favour of the baby grand duke peter petrovich brutal reign of terror ensued in the course of which the ex tsaritsa eudoxia was dragged from her monastery and publicly tried for alleged adultery while all who had in any way befriended alexei were impaled or broken on the wheel while having their flesh torn with red hot pincers or their bare backs or bare feet slowly roasted over burning coals and were otherwise lingeringly done to death all this was done to terrorize the reactionaries and isolate the tsarevich in april fresh confessions were extorted from and in regard to alexei this included the words of afrosinia who had turned state evidence shall bring back the old people alexei is reported to have told her and choose myself new ones according to my will when become sovereign shall live in moscow and leave saint petersburg simply as any other town won launch any ships shall maintain troops only for defense and won make war on anyone shall be content with the old domains in winter shall live in moscow and in summer in iaroslavl despite this and other hearsay evidence there were no facts to go upon the worst that could be brought against him was that he had wished his father death in the eyes of peter his son was now self convicted and most dangerous traitor whose life was forfeit but there was no getting over the fact that his father had sworn to pardon him and let him live in peace if he returned to russia the whole matter was solemnly submitted to grand council of prelates senators ministers and other dignitaries on june the clergy for their part declared the tsarevich alexei had placed his confidence in those who loved the ancient customs and that he had become acquainted with them by the discourses they held wherein they had constantly praised the ancient manners and spoke with distaste of the novelties his father had introduced declaring this to be civil rather than an ecclesiastical matter the clergy left the matter to the tsar own decision at noon on june the temporal dignitaries the members of both the senate and magistrates that comprised the court declared alexei guilty and sentenced him to death but the examination by torture continued so desperate was peter to uncover any possible collusion on june the weak and ailing tsarevich received twenty five strokes with the knout and then on the th he was subject to fifteen more on june alexei died in the peter and paul fortress in saint petersburg two days after the senate had condemned him to death for conspiring rebellion against his father and for hoping for the cooperation of the common people and the armed intervention of his brother in law the

was accomplished shortly before his death jackson was widely revered in the united states as an advocate for democracy and the common man but his reputation has declined since the civil rights

robert born jackson father died in logging accident while clearing land in february at the age of three weeks before his son andrew was born jackson his mother and his brothers lived with jackson aunt and uncle in the waxhaws region and jackson received schooling from two nearby priests jackson exact birthplace is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making difficult trip home from burying jackson father the area was so remote that the border between north and south carolina had not been officially surveyed in jackson wrote letter saying that he was born on the plantation of his uncle james crawford in lancaster county south carolina jackson may have claimed to be south carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the tariff of which he opposed in the mid second hand evidence indicated that he might have been born at different uncle home in north carolina revolutionary war service lithograph alt sketch of soldier preparing to strike boy with sword the boy holds out his arm in self defense during the revolutionary war jackson eldest brother hugh died from heat exhaustion after the battle of stono ferry on june anti british sentiment intensified

brothers release she then began to walk both boys back to their home in the waxhaws distance of some miles both were in very poor health robert who was far worse rode on the only horse that they had while andrew walked behind them in the final two hours of the journey torrential downpour began which worsened the effects of the smallpox within two days of arriving back home robert was dead and andrew in mortal danger after nursing andrew back to health elizabeth volunteered to nurse american prisoners of war on board two british ships in the charleston harbor where there had been an outbreak of cholera in november she died from the disease and was buried in an unmarked grave andrew became an orphan at age he blamed the british personally for the loss of his brothers and mother

nashville in where he lived as boarder with rachel stockly donelson the widow of john donelson here jackson became acquainted with their daughter rachel donelson robards at the time the younger rachel was in an unhappy marriage with captain lewis robards he was subject to fits of jealous rage the two were separated in according to jackson he married rachel after hearing that robards had obtained divorce however the divorce had never been completed making rachel marriage to jackson bigamous and therefore invalid after the divorce was officially completed rachel and jackson remarried in to complicate matters further evidence shows that rachel had been living with jackson and referred to herself as mrs jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made it was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially as long as they were recognized by the community land speculation and early public career in jackson formed partnership with fellow lawyer john overton dealing in claims for reserved by treaty for the cherokee and chickasaw like many of their contemporaries they dealt in such claims although the land was in indian country most of the transactions involved grants made under the land grab act of that briefly opened indian lands west of the appalachians within north carolina to claim by that state residents he was one of the

disgusted with the administration of president john adams and resigned the following year without explanation upon returning home with strong support from western tennessee he was elected to serve as judge of the tennessee supreme court at an annual salary of jackson service as judge is generally viewed as success and earned him reputation for honesty and good decision making jackson resigned the judgeship in his official reason for resigning was ill health he had been suffering financially from poor land ventures and so it is also possible that he wanted to return full time to his business interests after arriving in tennessee jackson won the appointment of judge advocate of the tennessee militia in while serving on the tennessee supreme court he declared his candidacy for major general or commander of the tennessee militia position voted on by the officers at that time most free men were members of the militia the organizations intended to be called up in case of conflict with europeans or indians resembled large social clubs jackson saw it as way to advance his stature with strong support from western tennessee he tied with john sevier with seventeen votes sevier was popular revolutionary war veteran and former governor the recognized leader of politics in eastern tennessee on february governor archibald roane broke the tie in jackson favor jackson had also presented roane with evidence of land fraud against sevier subsequently in when sevier announced his intention to regain the governorship roane released the evidence sevier insulted jackson in public and the two nearly fought duel over the matter despite the charges leveled against sevier he defeated roane and continued to serve as governor until planting career and controversy notice of reward

gallatin tennessee in the next year he acquired the hermitage plantation in davidson county near nashville he later added to the plantation which eventually totaled the primary crop was cotton grown by slaves jackson began with nine owned as many as by and later up to placing him among the planter elite jackson also co owned with his son andrew jackson jr the halcyon plantation in coahoma county mississippi which housed slaves at the time of his death throughout his lifetime jackson may have owned as many as slaves men women and child slaves were owned by jackson on three sections of the hermitage plantation slaves lived in extended family units of between five and ten persons and were quartered in cabins made either of brick or logs the size and quality of the hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times to help slaves acquire food jackson supplied them with guns knives and fishing equipment at times he paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets the hermitage plantation was profit making enterprise jackson permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves offenses were severe enough at various times he posted advertisements for fugitive slaves who had escaped from his plantation for the standards of his times jackson was considered humane slave owner who furnished his slaves food and housing and he did not prohibit his female slaves from having children the controversy surrounding his marriage to rachel remained sore point for jackson who deeply resented attacks on his wife honor by may charles dickinson who like jackson raced horses had published an attack on jackson in the local newspaper and it resulted in written challenge from jackson to duel since dickinson was considered an expert shot jackson determined it would be best to let dickinson turn and fire first hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness jackson would wait and take careful aim at dickinson dickinson did fire first hitting jackson in the chest the bullet that struck jackson was so close to his heart that it could not be removed under the rules of dueling dickinson had to remain still as jackson took aim and shot and killed him jackson behavior in the duel outraged men in tennessee who called it brutal cold blooded killing and saddled jackson with reputation as violent vengeful man he became social outcast after the sevier affair and the duel jackson was looking for way to salvage his reputation he chose to align himself with former vice president aaron burr who after leaving office in went on tour of the western united states during that time he stayed for several days at the hermitage burr true intentions are not known with certainty he seems to have been planning military operation to conquer spanish florida and drive the spanish from texas to many westerners like jackson the promise seemed enticing western american settlers had long held bitter feelings towards the spanish due to territorial disputes and the persistent failure of the spanish to keep indians living on their lands from raiding american settlements on october jackson addressed the tennessee militia declaring that the men should be at moment warning ready to march on the same day he wrote to james winchester proclaiming that the united states can conquer not only the floridas but all spanish north america he continued jackson agreed to provide boats and other provisions for the expedition however on november he learned from military captain that burr plans apparently included seizure of new orleans then part of the louisiana territory of the united states and incorporating it along with lands won from the spanish into new empire he was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of brigadier general james wilkinson whom he deeply disliked in the plan jackson acted cautiously at first but wrote letters to public officials including president thomas jefferson vaguely warning them about the scheme in december jefferson political opponent of burr issued proclamation declaring that treasonous plot was underway in the west and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators jackson safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail organized the militia burr was soon captured and the men were sent home jackson traveled to richmond virginia to testify on burr behalf in trial the defense team decided against placing him on the witness stand fearing his remarks were too provocative burr was acquitted of treason despite jefferson efforts to have him convicted jackson endorsed james monroe for president in against james madison the latter was part of the jeffersonian wing of the democratic republican party military career war of creek campaign and treaty ralph earl alt white haired man in blue army uniform with epaulettes leading up to the united states found itself increasingly drawn into international conflict formal hostilities with spain or france never materialized but tensions with britain increased for number of reasons among these was the desire of many americans for more land particularly british canada and florida the latter still controlled by spain britain european ally on june congress officially declared war on the united kingdom of great britain and ireland beginning the war of jackson responded sending letter to washington offering volunteers however the men were not called up for many months biographer robert remini claims that jackson saw the apparent slight as payback by the madison administration for his support of burr and monroe meanwhile the united states military repeatedly suffered devastating defeats on the battlefield on january jackson led an army of volunteers to new orleans to defend the region against british and native american attacks he had been instructed to serve under general wilkinson who commanded federal forces in new orleans lacking adequate provisions wilkinson ordered jackson to halt in natchez then part of the mississippi territory and await further orders jackson reluctantly obeyed the newly appointed secretary of war john armstrong jr sent letter to jackson dated february ordering him to dismiss his forces and to turn over his supplies to wilkinson in reply to armstrong on march jackson defended the character and readiness of his men and promised to turn over his supplies however he also promised instead of dismissing the troops without provisions in natchez to march them back to nashville the march was filled with agony many of the men had fallen ill jackson and his officers turned over their horses to the sick he paid for provisions for the men out of his own pocket the soldiers began referring to their commander as hickory because of his toughness and jackson became known as old hickory the army arrived in nashville within about month jackson actions earned him the widespread respect and praise of the people of tennessee on june jackson served as second in duel on behalf of his junior officer william carroll against jesse benton in september jackson and his top cavalry officer brigadier general john coffee were involved in street brawl with jesse and his brother thomas who was jackson aide de camp jackson was severely wounded by jesse with gunshot to the shoulder on august group of muscogee also known as creek indians called the red sticks so named for the color of their war paint perpetrated the fort mims massacre during the massacre hundreds of white american settlers and non red stick creeks were slaughtered the red sticks led by chiefs red eagle and peter mcqueen had broken away from the rest of the creek confederacy which wanted peace with the united states they were allied with tecumseh shawnee chief who had launched tecumseh war against the united states and who was fighting alongside the british the resulting conflict became known as the creek war in the treaty of fort jackson the muscogee surrendered large parts of present day alabama and georgia jackson with men was ordered to crush the hostile indians on october he set out on the expedition his arm still in sling jackson established fort strother as supply base on november coffee defeated band of red sticks at the battle of tallushatchee coming to the relief of friendly creeks besieged by red sticks jackson won another decisive victory at the battle of talladega in the winter jackson encamped at fort strother faced severe shortage of troops due to the expiration of enlistments and chronic desertions he sent coffee with the cavalry which abandoned him back to tennessee to secure more enlistments jackson decided to combine his force with that of the georgia militia and marched to meet the georgia troops from january while on their way the tennessee militia and allied muscogee were attacked by the red sticks at the battles of emuckfaw and enotachopo creek jackson troops repelled the attackers but outnumbered were forced to withdraw to fort strother jackson now with over troops marched most of his army south to confront the red sticks at fortress they had constructed at bend in the tallapoosa river on march enjoying an advantage of more than to he engaged them at the battle of horseshoe bend an initial artillery barrage did little damage to the well constructed fort however subsequent infantry charge in addition to an assault by coffee cavalry and diversions caused by the friendly creeks overwhelmed the red sticks the campaign ended three weeks later with red eagle surrender although some red sticks such as mcqueen fled to east florida on june jackson accepted commission as brigadier general in the united states army and days later became major general in command of the seventh military division subsequently jackson with madison approval imposed the treaty of fort jackson the treaty required the muscogee including those who had not joined the red sticks to surrender million acres of land to the united states though in ill health from dysentery jackson turned his attention to defeating spanish and british forces jackson accused the spanish of arming the red sticks and of violating the terms of their neutrality by allowing british soldiers into the floridas the first charge was true while the second ignored the fact that it was jackson threats to invade florida which had caused them to seek british protection in the november battle of pensacola jackson defeated british and spanish forces in short skirmish the spanish surrendered and the british fled weeks later he learned that the british were planning an attack on new orleans which sat on the mouth of the mississippi river and held immense strategic and commercial value jackson abandoned pensacola to the spanish placed force in mobile alabama to guard against possible invasion there and rushed the rest of his force west to defend the city the creeks coined their own name for

loyalty of the city creole and spanish inhabitants at the same time he formed an alliance with jean lafitte smugglers and formed military units consisting of african americans and muscogees in addition to recruiting volunteers in the city jackson received some criticism for paying white and non white volunteers the same salary these forces along with army regulars and volunteers from surrounding states joined with jackson force in defending new orleans the approaching british force led by admiral alexander cochrane and later general edward pakenham consisted of over soldiers many

right glove on the ground he is writing on papers and stands beside cannon the british arrived on the east bank of the mississippi river on the morning of december that evening jackson attacked the british and temporarily drove them back on january the british launched major frontal assault against jackson defenses despite some success in attacking the right flank the overall attack ended in disaster for the battle on january jackson admitted to only total casualties of these men were killed wounded and missing or captured the british however admitted casualties of these men were killed including pakenham wounded and missing or captured after the battle the british retreated from the area and open hostilities ended shortly thereafter when word spread that the treaty of ghent had been signed in europe that december coming in the waning days of the war jackson victory made him national hero as the country celebrated the end of what many called the second american revolution against the british by congressional resolution on february jackson was given the thanks of congress and awarded congressional gold medal alexis de tocqueville underwhelmed by jackson according to commentator

newspaper challenging jackson refusal to release the militia after the british ceded the field of battle jackson did not relent his campaign of suppressing dissent until after ordering the arrest of louisiana legislator federal judge and lawyer and after the intervention of state judge joshua lewis lewis was simultaneously serving under jackson in the militia and also had signed writ of habeas corpus against jackson his commanding officer seeking judge hall release civilian authorities in new orleans had reason to fear jackson he summarily ordered the execution of six members of the militia who had attempted to leave their deaths were not well publicized until the coffin handbills were circulated during his presidential campaign first seminole war alt two soldiers stand trial several other men gather around following the war jackson remained in command of army forces on the southern border of the he conducted official business from the hermitage he signed treaties with the cherokee and chickasaw which gained for the united states large parts of tennessee and kentucky the treaty with the chickasaw finally agreed to later in the year is commonly known as the jackson purchase several native american tribes which became known as the seminole straddled the border between the and florida the seminole in alliance with escaped slaves frequently raided georgia settlements before retreating back into florida these skirmishes continually escalated and the conflict is now known as the first seminole war in jackson led detachment into florida which destroyed the negro fort community of escaped slaves and their descendants jackson was ordered by president james monroe in december to lead campaign in georgia against the seminole and creek indians jackson was also charged with preventing spanish florida from becoming refuge for runaway slaves after spain promised freedom to fugitive slaves critics later alleged that jackson exceeded orders in his florida actions his orders from president monroe were to terminate the conflict jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize florida from spain once and for all before departing jackson wrote to monroe let it be signified to me through any channel that the possession of the floridas would be desirable to the united states and in sixty days it will be accomplished teracotta bust by alt bust of jackson in military uniform hair is wavy and falls partway down the forehead jackson invaded florida on march capturing pensacola he crushed seminole and spanish resistance in the region and captured two british agents robert ambrister and alexander arbuthnot who had been working with the seminole after brief trial jackson executed both of the men causing diplomatic incident with the british jackson actions polarized monroe cabinet some of whom argued that jackson had gone against monroe orders and violated the constitution since the united states had not declared war upon spain yet jackson was defended by secretary of state john quincy adams adams thought that jackson conquest of florida would force spain to finally sell the province and spain did indeed sell florida to the united states in the adams onís treaty of congressional investigation exonerated jackson but jackson was deeply angered by the criticism he received particularly from speaker of the house henry clay after the ratification of the adams onís treaty in jackson briefly served as the territorial governor of florida before returning to tennessee presidential aspirations election of jackson in painted by alt man with wavy gray hair in white shirt black bowtie and black coat faces left in the spring of jackson suffered physical breakdown his body had two bullets lodged in it and he had grown exhausted from years of hard military campaigning he regularly coughed up blood and his entire body shook jackson feared that he was on the brink of death after several months of rest he recovered during his convalescence jackson thoughts increasingly turned to national affairs he obsessed over rampant corruption in the monroe administration and grew to detest the second bank of the united states blaming it for causing the panic of by contracting credit jackson turned down an offer to run for governor of his home state but accepted john overton plan to have the legislature nominate him for president on july he was officially nominated by the tennessee legislature jackson had come to dislike secretary of the treasury william crawford who had been the most vocal critic of jackson in monroe cabinet and he hoped to prevent tennessee electoral votes from going to crawford yet jackson nomination garnered welcoming response even outside of tennessee as many americans appreciated jackson attacks on banks the panic of had devastated the fortunes of many and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular with his growing political viability jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates along with crawford secretary of state adams speaker of the house henry clay and secretary of war john calhoun during the era of good feelings the federalist party had faded away and all five presidential contenders were members of the democratic republican party jackson campaign promoted him as defender of the common people as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions on the major issues of the day most prominently the tariff jackson expressed centrist beliefs and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions at the forefront of jackson campaign was combatting corruption jackson vowed to restore honesty in government and to scale back its excesses in jackson reluctantly allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of tennessee senate seats the move was independently orchestrated by his advisors william berkeley lewis and senator john eaton in order to defeat incumbent john williams who openly opposed his presidential candidacy the legislature narrowly elected him his return after years months days out of office marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history although jackson was reluctant to serve once more in the senate eaton wrote to rachel that jackson as senator was in harmony and good understanding with every body including thomas hart benton now senator from missouri with whom jackson had fought in meanwhile jackson himself did little active campaigning for the presidency as was customary eaton updated an already written biography of him in preparation for the campaign and along with others wrote letters to newspapers praising jackson record and past conduct democratic republican presidential nominees had historically been chosen by informal congressional nominating caucuses but this method had become unpopular in most of the democratic republicans in congress boycotted the caucus those who attended backed crawford for president and albert gallatin for vice president pennsylvania convention nominated jackson for president month later stating that the irregular caucus ignored the voice of the people and was vain hope that the american people might be thus deceived into belief that he crawford was the regular democratic candidate gallatin criticized jackson as an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory but from incapacity military habits and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions altogether unfit for the office after jackson won the pennsylvania nomination calhoun dropped out of the presidential race and successfully sought the vice presidency instead in the presidential election jackson won plurality of the electoral vote taking several southern and western states as well as the mid atlantic states of pennsylvania and new jersey he was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base as adams dominated new england clay took three western states and crawford won virginia and georgia jackson won plurality of the popular vote taking percent although not all states held popular vote for the presidency he won electoral votes more than any other candidates but still short of which he needed for true majority with no candidate having won majority of the electoral the house of representatives held contingent election under the terms of the twelfth amendment the amendment specifies that only the top three electoral vote winners are eligible to be elected by the house so clay was eliminated from contention jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election as crawford and adams lacked jackson national appeal and crawford had suffered debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency however clay who as speaker of the house presided over the election saw jackson as dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership he threw his support behind adams who shared clay support for federally funded internal improvements such as roads and canals with clay backing adams won the contingent election on the first ballot furious supporters of jackson accused clay and adams of having reached corrupt bargain after adams appointed clay as his secretary of state so you see jackson growled the judas of the west has closed the contract and receive the thirty pieces of silver his end will be the same after the election jackson resigned his senate seat and returned to tennessee election of and death of rachel jackson election results almost immediately opposition arose to the adams presidency jackson opposed adams plan to involve the in panama quest for independence writing the moment we engage in confederations or alliances with any nation we may from that time date the down fall of our republic adams also damaged his standing in his first annual message to congress when he argued that congress must not give the world the impression that we are palsied by the will of our constituents jackson was nominated for president by tennessee legislature in october more than three years before the election it was the earliest such nomination in presidential history and it attested to the fact that jackson supporters began the campaign almost as soon as the campaign ended adams presidency floundered as his ambitious agenda faced defeat in new era of mass politics critics led by jackson attacked adams policies as dangerous expansion of federal power senator martin van buren who had been prominent supporter of crawford in the election emerged as one of the strongest opponents of adams policies and he settled on jackson as his preferred candidate in the election van buren was joined by vice president calhoun who also opposed much of adams agenda on states rights grounds van buren and other jackson allies established numerous pro jackson newspapers and clubs around the country while jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his hermitage plantation in the election jackson won commanding percent of the popular vote and percent of the electoral vote the election marked the definitive end of the one party era of good feelings as jackson supporters coalesced into the democratic party and adams followers became known as the national republicans in the large scots irish community that was especially numerous in the rural south and southwest jackson was favorite hero the campaign was very much personal one as was the custom at the time neither candidate personally campaigned but their political followers organized many campaign events both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press jackson was strongly attacked as slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of higher standards of slaveholder behavior series of pamphlets known as the coffin handbills were published to attack jackson one of which revealed his order to execute soldiers at new orleans another accused him of engaging in cannibalism by eating the bodies of american indians killed in battle while still another labeled his mother common prostitute and stated that jackson father was mulatto man rachel jackson was also frequent target of attacks and was widely accused of bigamy reference to the controversial situation of her marriage with jackson jackson campaigners fired back by claiming that while serving as minister to russia adams had procured young girl to serve as prostitute for emperor alexander they also stated that adams had billiard table in the white house and that he had charged the government for it rachel had been under extreme stress during the election and often struggled while jackson was away she began experiencing significant physical stress during the election season jackson described her symptoms as excruciating pain in the left shoulder arm and breast after struggling for three days rachel finally died of heart attack on december three weeks after her husband victory in the election which began on october and ended on december and weeks before jackson took office as president distraught jackson had to be pulled from her so the undertaker could prepare the body he felt that the accusations from adams supporters had hastened her death and never forgave him rachel was buried at the hermitage on christmas eve may god almighty forgive her murderers jackson swore at her funeral never can presidency alt man stands in white shirt and black pants and coat with right hand on desk and left hand at his side philosophy jackson name has been associated with jacksonian democracy or the shift and expansion of democracy with the passing of some political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties the age of jackson shaped the national agenda and american politics jackson philosophy as president was similar to that of jefferson advocating republican values held by the revolutionary war generation jackson took moral tone with the belief that agrarian sympathies and limited view of states rights and the federal government would produce less corruption he feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values when south carolina opposed the tariff law he took strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession jackson believed in the ability of the people to arrive at right conclusions they had the right not only to elect but to instruct their agents representatives office holders should either obey the popular will or resign he rejected the view of powerful and independent supreme court with binding decisions arguing that tthe congress the executive and the court must each or itself be guided by its own opinions of the constitution jackson thought that supreme court justices should be made to stand for election and believed in strict constructionism as the best way to insure democratic rule he called for term limits on presidents and the abolition of the electoral college jackson was far ahead of his times and maybe even further than this country can ever achieve inauguration jackson departed from the hermitage on january and arrived in washington on february he then set about choosing his cabinet members jackson chose van buren as expected for secretary of state eaton of tennessee as secretary of war samuel ingham of pennsylvania as secretary of treasury john branch of north carolina as secretary of navy john berrien of georgia as attorney general and william barry of kentucky as postmaster general jackson first choice of cabinet proved to be unsuccessful full of bitter partisanship and gossip jackson blamed adams in part for what was said about rachel during the campaign and refused to meet him after arriving in washington therefore adams chose not to attend the inauguration on march andrew jackson became the first united states president elect to take the oath of office on the east portico of the capitol in his inaugural speech jackson promised to respect the sovereign powers of states and the constitutional limits of the presidency he also promised to pursue reform by removing power from unfaithful or incompetent hands at the conclusion of the ceremony jackson invited the public to the white house where his supporters held raucous party thousands of spectators overwhelmed the white house staff and minor damage was caused to fixtures and furnishings jackson populism earned him the nickname king mob petticoat affair jackson devoted considerable amount of his presidential time during his early years in office responding to what came to be known as the petticoat affair or eaton affair washington gossip circulated among jackson cabinet members and their wives including calhoun wife floride calhoun concerning secretary of war eaton and his wife peggy eaton salacious rumors held that peggy as barmaid in her father tavern had been sexually promiscuous or had even been prostitute controversy also ensued because peggy had married soon after her previous husband death and it was alleged that she and her husband had engaged in an adulterous affair while her previous husband was still living petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members led by mrs calhoun refused to socialize with the eatons allowing prostitute in the official family was of course unthinkable but jackson refused to believe the rumors telling his cabinet that she is as chaste as virgin jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers who in essence questioned and dishonored jackson himself by in attempting to drive the eatons out daring to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet jackson was also reminded of the attacks that were made against his wife these memories increased his dedication to defending peggy eaton meanwhile the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all american women was at stake they believed responsible woman should never accord man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable historian daniel walker howe notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the woman rights movement secretary of state martin van buren widower was already forming coalition against calhoun he could now see his main chance to strike hard he took the side of jackson and eaton in the spring of jackson at van buren suggestion demanded the resignations of all the cabinet member except barry van buren himself resigned to avoid the appearance of bias in jackson nominated van buren to be minister to great britain calhoun blocked the nomination with tie breaking vote against it claiming the defeated nomination would kill him sir kill dead he will never kick sir never kick van buren however fully recovered he continued to serve as an important advisor to jackson and was placed on the ticket for vice president in the election making him jackson heir apparent the petticoat affair led to the development of the kitchen cabinet the kitchen cabinet emerged as an unofficial group of advisors to the president its existence was partially rooted in jackson difficulties with his official cabinet even after the purging indian removal policy indian tribes from their traditional territories including the trail of tears throughout his eight years in office jackson made about treaties with native american tribes both in the south and the northwest jackson presidency marked new era in indian anglo american relations initiating policy of indian removal jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various indian tribes though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates the southern tribes included the choctaw creek chickasaw seminole and the cherokee the northwest tribes include the chippewa ottawa and the potawatomi relations between indians and americans increasingly grew tense and sometimes violent as result of territorial conflicts previous presidents had at times supported removal or attempts to civilize the indians but generally let the problem play itself out with minimal intervention there had developed growing popular and political movement to deal with the issue and out of this policy to relocate certain indian populations jackson never known for timidity became an advocate for this relocation policy in what many historians consider the most controversial aspect of his presidency in his first annual message to congress jackson advocated land west of the mississippi river be set aside for indian tribes on may congress passed the indian removal act which jackson signed into law two days later the act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands farther west outside of existing state borders the act specifically pertained to the five civilized tribes in the south the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey state law jackson eaton and general coffee negotiated with the chickasaw who quickly agreed to move jackson put eaton and coffee in charge of negotiating with the choctaw lacking jackson skills at negotiation they frequently bribed to the chiefs in order to gain their submission the tactics worked and the chiefs agreed to move the removal of the choctaw took place in the winter of and and was wrought with misery and suffering the seminole despite the signing of the treaty of payne landing in refused to move in december this dispute began the second seminole war the war lasted over six years finally ending in members of the creek nation had signed the treaty of cusseta in allowing the creek to either sell or retain their land however conflict later erupted between the creek who remained and the white settlers leading to second creek war common complaint was that the men who had signed the treaties did not represent the whole tribe alt white haired man stands outdoors beside tree with cane the state of georgia became involved in contentious dispute with the cherokee culminating in the supreme court decision in worcester georgia in that decision supreme court chief justice john marshall writing for the court ruled that georgia could not forbid whites from entering tribal lands as it had attempted to do with two missionaries supposedly stirring up resistance amongst the tribespeople jackson is frequently attributed the following response john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it the quote apparently indicating jackson dismissive view of the courts was attributed to jackson by horace greeley who cited as his source representative george briggs remini argues that jackson did not say it because while it certainly sounds like jackson there was nothing for him to enforce this is because writ of habeas corpus had never been issued for the missionaries the court also did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision as had become standard group of cherokees led by john ridge negotiated the treaty of new echota ridge was not widely recognized leader of the cherokee and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate another faction led by john ross unsuccessfully petitioned to protest the proposed removal the cherokee largely considered themselves independent and not subject to the laws of the united states or georgia the treaty was enforced by jackson successor van buren subsequently as many as out of cherokees died on the trail of tears in more than american indians were relocated to the west during jackson administration though few cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high smoky mountains the black hawk war took place during jackson presidency in after group of indians crossed into territory reforms rotation of offices and spoils system in an effort to purge the government of corruption jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive cabinet offices and departments he believed appointees should be hired on merit and withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies he asked congress to reform embezzlement laws reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties and laws to improve government accounting jackson postmaster general barry resigned after congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances jackson replaced barry with treasury auditor and prominent kitchen cabinet member amos kendall who went on to implement much needed reforms in the post office department jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the electoral college by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to congress as president in his third annual message to congress he expressed the view have heretofore recommended amendments of the federal constitution giving the election of president and vice president to the people and limiting the service of the former to single term so important do consider these changes in our fundamental law that can not in accordance with my sense of duty omit to press them upon the consideration of new congress although he was unable to implement this goal jackson time in office did see variety of other reforms he supported an act in july that enabled widows of revolutionary war soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husband pensions in jackson established the ten hour day in national shipyards jackson enforced the tenure of office act signed by president monroe in that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates jackson believed that rotation in office was actually democratic reform preventing father to son succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was leading principle in the republican creed jackson noted in country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of corrupt bureaucracy the number of federal office holders removed by jackson were exaggerated by his opponents jackson only rotated about of federal office holders during his first term some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes jackson however did use his image and presidential power to award loyal democrats by granting them federal office appointments jackson approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office having appointed soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to postmastership jackson stated if he lost his leg fighting for his country that is enough for me jackson theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called the spoils system the political realities of washington however ultimately forced jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations historians believe jackson presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of washington such as the new york customs house the postal service the departments of navy and war and the bureau of indian affairs whose budget had increased enormously in the previous two decades proved to be difficult remini claims that because friendship politics and geography constituted the president total criteria for appointments most of his appointments were predictably substandard nullification crisis in congress had approved the tariff of abominations which set the tariff at an historically high rate southern planters who sold their cotton on the world market strongly opposed this tariff which they saw as favoring northern interests the south now had to pay more for goods it did not produce locally and other countries would have more difficulty affording southern cotton the issue came to head during jackson presidency resulting in the nullification crisis in which south carolina threatened disunion the south carolina exposition and protest of secretly written by calhoun asserted that their state had the right to nullify declare void the tariff legislation of although jackson sympathized with the south in the tariff debate he also vigorously supported strong union with effective powers for the central government jackson attempted to face down calhoun over the issue which developed into bitter rivalry between the two men one incident came at the april jefferson day dinner involving after dinner toasts robert hayne began by toasting to the union of the states and the sovereignty of the states jackson then rose and in booming voice added our federal union it must be preserved clear challenge to calhoun calhoun clarified his position by responding the union next to our liberty the most dear in may jackson discovered that calhoun had asked president monroe to censure then general jackson for his invasion of spanish florida in while calhoun was serving as secretary of war calhoun and jackson relationship deteriorated further by february the break between calhoun and jackson was final responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud calhoun had published letters between him and jackson detailing the conflict in the united states telegraph jackson and calhoun began an angry correspondence which lasted until jackson stopped it in july the telegraph edited by duff green had previously supported jackson after it took the side of calhoun jackson needed new organ for the administration he enlisted the help of longtime supporter francis preston blair who in november established newspaper known as the washington globe which from then on served as the primary mouthpiece of the democratic party jackson supported revision to tariff rates known as the tariff of it was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates written by treasury secretary louis mclane the bill lowered duties from to in may representative john quincy adams introduced slightly revised version of the bill which jackson accepted it passed congress on july and was signed by the president on july however the bill failed to satisfy extremists on either side on november the south carolina legislature officially nullified both the tariff of and the tariff of in response jackson sent navy warships to charleston harbor and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession on december with less than two months remaining in his term calhoun resigned as vice president to become senator for south carolina this was part of strategy whereby calhoun with less than three months remaining on his vice presidential term would replace robert hayne in the senate who would then become governor hayne had often struggled to defend nullification on the floor of the senate especially against fierce criticism from senator daniel webster of massachusetts in december jackson issued resounding proclamation against the nullifiers stating that he considered the power to annul law of the united states assumed by one state incompatible with the existence of the union contradicted expressly by the letter of the constitution unauthorized by its spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded and destructive of the great object for which it was formed south carolina the president declared stood on the brink of insurrection and treason and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that union for which their ancestors had fought jackson also denied the right of secession the constitution forms government not league to say that any state may at pleasure secede from the union is to say that the united states are not nation jackson tended to personalize the controversy frequently characterizing nullification as conspiracy between disappointed and bitter men whose ambitions had been thwarted jackson asked congress to pass force bill explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff it was introduced by senator felix grundy of tennessee and was quickly attacked by calhoun was military despotism at the same time calhoun and clay began to work on new compromise tariff bill sponsored by the administration had been introduced by representative gulian verplanck of new york but it lowered rates more sharply than clay and other protectionists desired however clay managed to get calhoun to agree to bill with higher rates in exchange for clay opposition to jackson military threats and perhaps with the hope that he could win some southern votes in his next bid for the presidency the compromise tariff passed on march the force bill passed the same day calhoun clay and several others marched out of the chamber in opposition with the only dissenting vote coming from john tyler of virginia the new tariff was opposed by webster who argued that it essentially surrendered to south carolina demands however jackson despite his intense anger over the scrapping of the verplanck bill and the new alliance between clay and calhoun saw it as an efficient way to end the crisis he signed both bills on march starting with the force bill the south carolina convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance but in final show of defiance nullified the force bill on may jackson wrote the tariff was only the pretext and disunion and southern confederacy the real object the next pretext will be the negro or slavery question foreign affairs william rives jackson minister to france successfully negotiated reparations treaty with france in alt dark haired man with white tie and black coat addressing the subject of foreign affairs in his first annual address to congress jackson declared it to be his settled purpose to ask nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong when jackson took office spoliation claims or compensation demands for the capture of american ships and sailors dating from the napoleonic era caused strained relations between the and french governments the french navy had captured and sent american ships to spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules according to secretary of state martin van buren relations between the and france were hopeless jackson minister to france william rives through diplomacy was able to convince the french government to sign reparations treaty on july that would award the in damages the french government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties the french king louis philippe and his ministers blamed the french chamber of deputies by the non payment of reparations by the french government drew jackson ire and he became impatient in his december state of the union address jackson sternly reprimanded the french government for non payment stating the federal government was wholly disappointed by the french and demanded congress authorize trade reprisals against france feeling insulted by jackson words the french people began pressuring their government not to pay the indemnity until jackson had apologized for his remarks in his december state of the union address jackson refused to apologize stating he had good opinion of the french people and his intentions were peaceful jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the french government was purposely stalling payment the french accepted jackson statements as sincere and in february reparations were paid in addition to france the jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with denmark portugal and spain jackson state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with russia spain turkey great britain and siam under the treaty of great britain american trade was reopened in the west indies the trade agreement with siam was america first treaty between the united states and an asiatic country as result american exports increased while imports increased jackson attempt to purchase texas from mexico for failed the chargé affaires in mexico colonel anthony butler suggested that the take texas over militarily but jackson refused butler was later replaced toward the end of jackson presidency in the texas revolution began when pro slavery american settlers in texas fought the mexican government for texan independence by may they had routed the mexican military establishing an independent republic of texas the new texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from president jackson and annexation into the united states however jackson was hesitant in recognizing texas unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from mexico and not wanting to make texas an anti slavery issue during the election the strategy worked the democratic party and national loyalties were held intact and van buren was elected president jackson formally recognized the republic of texas nominating alcée louis la branche as chargé affaires on the last full day of his presidency march jackson failed in his efforts to open trade with china and japan he was unsuccessful at thwarting great britain presence and power in south america bank veto and election of election results devil bank nicholas biddle portrayed as the devil along with several speculators and hirelings flee as the bank collapses while jackson supporters cheer the presidential election demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period the democratic party first national convention held in baltimore nominated jackson choice for vice president van buren the national republican party who had held their first convention in baltimore earlier in december nominated henry clay now senator from kentucky and john sergeant of pennsylvania the anti masonic party emerged by capitalizing on capitalizing on opposition to freemasonry which existed primarily in new england after the disappearance and possible murder of william morgan the party which had earlier held its convention also in baltimore in september nominated william wirt of maryland and amos ellmaker of pennsylvania clay was like jackson mason and so some anti jacksonians who would have supported the national republican party supported wirt instead in the second bank of the united states was chartered by president james madison to restore the united states economy devastated by the war of monroe had appointed nicholas biddle as the bank executive clay hoped to make the bank an issue in the election so as to accuse jackson of going beyond his powers if he vetoed the bill in january biddle submitted to congress renewal of the bank charter four years before the original year charter was to end biddle recharter bill passed the senate on june and the house on july jackson believed that bank was fundamentally corrupt monopoly its stock was mostly held by foreigners he insisted and it exerted an unfair amount of control over the political system he vetoed the bill on july jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values believing the bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy jackson stated the bank made the rich richer and the potent more powerful he accused it of making loans with the intent of influencing elections the national republican party immediately made jackson veto of the bank political issue jackson political opponents castigated the veto as the very slang of the leveller and demagogue claiming jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man jackson however managed to successfully portray his veto as defense of the common man against governmental tyranny clay proved to be no match to jackson ability to resonate with the people and the democratic party strong political networks democratic newspapers parades barbecues and rallies increased jackson popularity at biddle direction the bank poured thousands of dollars into campaign to defeat jackson seemingly confirming jackson view that it interfered in the political process jackson himself made numerous public appearances on his return trip from tennessee to washington jackson won the election by landslide receiving percent of the popular vote and electoral votes clay received percent of the popular vote and electoral votes wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the anti masonic party eventually declined jackson believed the solid victory was popular mandate for his veto of the bank recharter and his continued warfare on the bank control over the national economy removal of deposits and censure in jackson attempted to begin removing federal deposits from the bank whose money lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across america thus drastically increasing credit and speculation jackson moves were greatly controversial he removed his moderately pro bank treasury secretary louis mclane having him serve instead as secretary of state replacing edward livingston he replaced mclane with william duane however in september he fired duane for refusing to remove the deposits he replaced him with attorney general roger taney strong opponent of the bank under taney the deposits began to be removed they were placed in variety of state banks which were friendly to the administration policies known by critics as pet banks biddle responded by stockpiling the bank reserves and contracting credit thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about financial panic intended to force jackson into compromise the move backfired increasing anti bank sentiment in those who opposed jackson expansion of executive power united and formed the whig party calling jackson king andrew and named their party after the english whigs who opposed eighteenth century british monarchy movement emerged among whigs in the senate to censure jackson the censure was political maneuver spearheaded by clay which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and jackson jackson called clay reckless and as full of fury as drunken man in brothel on march the senate voted to censure jackson it also rejected taney as treasury secretary the house however led by ways and means committee chairman james polk declared on april that the bank out not to be rechartered and that the depositions ought not to be restored it also voted to continue to allow pet banks to be placeds of deposit and voted even more overwhelmingly to investigate whether the bank had deliberately instigated the panic jackson called the passage of these resolutions glorious triumph it essentially sealed the bank demise the democrats later suffered temporary setback polk ran for speaker of the house to replace andrew stevenson after southerners discovered his connection to van buren he was defeated by fellow tennessean john bell democrat turned whig who opposed jackson removal policy the national economy following the withdrawal of the remaining funds from the bank was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills on january jackson paid off the entire national debt the only time in history that has been accomplished the objective had been reached in part through jackson reforms aimed at eliminating the misuse of funds and through his veto of legislation had he deemed extravagant in december polk defeated bell and was elected speaker finally on january when the jacksonians had majority in the senate the censure was expunged after years of effort by jackson supporters the expunction movement was led by thomas hart benton who despite the brawl years earlier had become an ardent supporter of the president in in response to increased land speculation jackson issued the specie circular an executive order that required buyers of government lands to pay in specie gold or silver coins the result was high demand for specie which many banks could not meet in exchange for their notes contributing to the panic of the white house van buren biography notes basically the trouble was the th century cyclical economy of boom and bust which was following its regular pattern but jackson financial measures contributed to the crash his destruction of the second bank of the united states had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks wild speculation in lands based on easy bank credit had swept the west to end this speculation jackson in had issued specie circular attack and assassination attempt richard lawrence attempt on jackson life as depicted in an etching alt several people in crowd man aims gun at jackson the first recorded physical attack on president was directed at jackson he had ordered the dismissal of robert randolph from the navy for embezzlement on may jackson sailed on uss cygnet to fredericksburg virginia where he was to lay the cornerstone on monument near the grave of mary ball washington george washington mother during stopover near alexandria randolph appeared and struck the president he fled the scene chased by several members of jackson party including the writer washington irving jackson declined to press charges on january what is believed to be the first attempt to kill sitting president of the united states occurred just outside the united states capitol when jackson was leaving through the east portico after the funeral of south carolina representative warren davis richard lawrence an unemployed house painter from england aimed pistol at jackson which misfired lawrence then pulled out second pistol which also misfired historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring jackson infuriated attacked lawrence with his cane others present including davy crockett restrained and disarmed lawrence lawrence offered variety of explanations for the shooting he blamed jackson for the loss of his job he claimed that with the president dead money would be more plenty reference to jackson struggle with the bank of the united states and that he could not rise until the president fell finally lawrence told his interrogators that he was deposed english king specifically richard iii dead since and that jackson was his clerk he was deemed insane and was afterwards the pistols were tested and retested each time they performed perfectly many believed that jackson had been protected by the same providence that they believed also protected their young nation the incident became part of jacksonian mythos jackson initially suspected that number of his political enemies might have orchestrated the attempt on his life his suspicions were never proven anti slavery tracts during the summer of northern abolitionists began sending anti slavery tracts through the postal system into the south pro slavery southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials which were deemed incendiary and some began to riot jackson wanted sectional peace and desired to placate southerners ahead of the election he fiercely disliked the abolitionists whom he believed were by instituting sectional jealousies attempting to destroy the union however jackson also did not want to condone open insurrection he supported the solution of postmaster general amos kendall which gave southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti slavery tracts that december jackson called on congress to prohibit the circulation through the south of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection exploring expedition alt sketch of ship with sails at sea jackson initially opposed any federal exploratory scientific expeditions during his first term in office the last scientific federally funded expeditions took place from to led by stephen harriman on the red river of the north jackson predecessor president adams attempted to launch scientific oceanic exploration in but congress was unwilling to fund the effort when jackson assumed office in he pocketed adams expedition plans however wanting to establish his presidential legacy similar to jefferson and the lewis and clark expedition jackson finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second term on may jackson signed law creating and funding the oceanic united states exploring expedition jackson put secretary of the navy mahlon dickerson in charge to assemble suitable ships officers and scientific staff for the expedition with planned launch before jackson term of office expired dickerson however proved unfit for the task preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until during the presidency of van buren one brig ship later used in the expedition having been commissioned by secretary dickerson in may circumnavigated the world and explored and mapped the southern ocean confirming the existence of the antarctica continent panic of alt political cartoon showing people suffering from economic trouble in spite of economic success following jakcson vetoes and war against the bank reckless speculation in land and railroads eventually caused the panic of contributing factors included jackson veto of the second national bank renewal charter in and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in that caused western banks to relax their lending standards two other jacksonian acts in contributed to the panic of the specie circular which mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver and the deposit and distribution act which transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks and in turn led to speculation frenzy by banks jackson specie circular albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy left many investors unable to afford to pay loans in gold and silver the same year there was downturn in great britain economy that stopped investment in the united states as result the economy went into depression banks became insolvent the national debt previously paid off increased business failures rose cotton prices dropped and unemployment dramatically increased the depression that followed lasted for four years until when the economy began to rebound administration and cabinet judicial appointments jackson appointed six justices to the supreme court of the united states most were undistinguished his first appointee john mclean had been nominated in barry place after barry had agreed to become postmaster general mclean turned whig and forever schemed to win the presidency his next two appointees henry baldwin and james moore wayne disagreed with jackson on some points but were poorly regarded even by jackson enemies in reward for his services jackson nominated taney to the court to fill vacancy in january but the nomination failed to win senate approval chief justice marshall died in leaving two vacancies on the court jackson nominated taney for chief justice and philip pendleton barbour for associate justice both were confirmed by the new senate taney served as chief justice until presiding over court that upheld many of the precedents set by the marshall court he was generally regarded as good and respectable judge but his opinion in dred scott sandford largely overshadows his career on the last full day of his presidency jackson nominated john catron who was confirmed states admitted to the union two new states were admitted into the union during jackson presidency arkansas june and michigan january both states increased democratic power in congress and helped van buren win the presidency in later life and death photographic copy of an alt wrinkled elderly man with spectacles in after serving two terms as president jackson was replaced by his chosen successor martin van buren and retired to the hermitage he immediately began putting it in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son andrew jr although he suffered ill health jackson remained highly influential in both national and state politics he was firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession insisting will die with the union blamed for causing the panic of he was unpopular in his early retirement jackson continued to denounce the perfidy and treachery of banks and urged his successor van buren to repudiate the specie circular as president as solution to the panic he supported an independent treasury system which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of gold or silver and would be restricted from printing paper money so as to prevent further inflation however coalition of conservative democrats and whigs opposed the bill and it was not passed until during the delay no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression van buren grew deeply unpopular unified whig party nominated popular war hero william henry harrison and former jacksonian john tyler in the presidential election the whigs campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the democrats when jackson ran they depicted van buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary americans while glorifying harrison military record and portraying him as man of the people jackson campaigned heavily for van buren in tennessee he favored the nomination of polk for vice president at the democratic national convention over controversial incumbent richard mentor johnson however no nominee was chosen and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors harrison won the election and the whigs captured majorities in both houses of congress the democracy of the united states has been shamefully beaten jackson wrote to van buren but trust not conquered however harrison died only month into his term and was replaced by tyler jackson was encouraged because tyler had strong independent streak and was not bound by party lines sure enough tyler quickly incurred the wrath of the whigs in when he vetoed two whig sponsored bills to establish new national bank bringing satisfaction to jackson and other democrats after the second veto tyler entire cabinet with the exception of daniel webster resigned jackson strongly favored the annexation of texas feat he had been unable to accomplish during his own presidency while jackson still feared that annexation would stir up anti slavery sentiment his belief that the british would use texas as base to threaten the united states overrode his other concerns he also insisted that texas was part of the louisiana purchase and therefore rightfully belonged to the united states at the request of senator robert walker of mississippi acting on behalf of the tyler administration which also supported annexation jackson wrote several letters to texas president sam houston urging him to wait for the senate to approve annexation and lecturing him on how much being part of the united states would benefit texas initially prior to the election jackson again supported van buren for president and polk for vice president treaty of annexation was signed by tyler on april and submitted to the senate when letter from calhoun to british ambassador richard pakenham linking annexation to slavery was made public anti annexation sentiment exploded in the north and the bill failed to be ratified van buren decided to write the hamlet letter opposing annexation this effectively extinguished any support that van buren might previously have enjoyed in the south the whig nominee henry clay also opposed annexation and jackson recognized the need for the democrats to nominate candidate who supported it and could therefore gain the support of the south if the plan failed jackson warned texas would not join the union and would potentially fall victim to mexican invasion supported by the british jackson met with polk robert armstrong and andrew jackson donelson in his study he then pointed directly at startled polk telling him that as man from the southwest and supporter of annexation he would be the perfect candidate polk called the scheme utterly abortive but agreed to go along with it at the democratic national convention polk emerged as the party nominee after van buren failed to win the required two thirds majority of delegates george dallas was selected for vice president jackson convinced tyler to drop his plans of running for re election as an independent by promising as tyler requested to welcome the president and his allies back into the democratic party and by instructing blair to stop criticizing the president polk won the election defeating clay bill of annexation was passed by congress in february and signed by tyler on march jackson died at his plantation on june at the age of of chronic dropsy and heart failure according to newspaper account from the boon lick times he fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed but he subsequently revived gen jackson died at the hermitage at clock on sunday the th instant when the messenger finally came the old soldier patriot and christian was looking out for his approach he is gone but his memory lives and will continue to live in his will jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son andrew jackson jr except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various friends and other family members personal life family jackson had three adopted sons theodore an indian about whom little is known andrew jackson jr the son of rachel brother severn donelson and lyncoya creek indian orphan adopted by jackson after the battle of tallushatchee lyncoya died of tuberculosis on july at the age of sixteen the jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children john samuel donelson daniel smith donelson

butler were the orphaned children of edward butler family friend they came to live with the jacksons after the death of their father the widower jackson invited rachel niece emily donelson to serve as hostess at the white house emily was married to andrew jackson donelson who acted as jackson private secretary and in ran for vice president on the american party ticket the relationship between the president and emily became strained during the petticoat affair and the two became estranged for over year they eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as white house hostess sarah yorke jackson the wife of andrew jackson jr became co hostess of the white house in it was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial first lady sarah took over all hostess duties after emily died from tuberculosis in jackson used rip raps as retreat temperament the hermitage alt painting of man with tall white hat cane black pants and coat and white shirt he is standing on grass beside tree jackson quick temper was notorious biographer brands notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper observers likened him to volcano and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt his close associates all had stories of his blood curdling oaths his summoning of the almighty to loose his wrath upon some miscreant typically followed by his own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition given his record in duels brawls mutiny trials and summary hearings listeners had to take his vows seriously on the last day of the presidency jackson admitted that he had but two regrets that he had been unable to shoot henry clay or to hang john calhoun on his deathbed he was once again quoted as regretting that he had not hanged calhoun my country would have sustained me in the act and his fate would have been warning to traitors in all time to come he said remini expresses the opinion that jackson was typically in control of his temper and that he used his anger along with his fearsome reputation as tool to get what he wanted physical appearance jackson was lean figure standing at tall and weighing between on average jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age he had penetrating deep blue eyes jackson was one of the more sickly presidents suffering from chronic headaches abdominal pains and hacking cough much of his trouble was caused by musket ball in his lung that was never removed that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake religious faith in jackson became an official member of the first presbyterian church in nashville both his mother and his wife had been devout presbyterians all their lives but jackson himself had postponed officially entering the church in order to avoid accusations that he was joining only for political reasons jackson was freemason initiated at harmony lodge no in tennessee he also participated in chartering several other lodges in tennessee he was the only president to have served as grand master of state grand lodge until harry truman in his masonic apron is on display in the tennessee state museum an obelisk and bronze masonic plaque decorate his tomb at the hermitage legacy historical reputation equestrian statue of gen jackson jackson county courthouse kansas city missouri commissioned by judge harry truman jackson remains one of the most studied and controversial figures in american history historian charles grier sellers says andrew jackson masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the american stage there has never been universal agreement on jackson legacy for his opponents have ever been his most bitter enemies and his friends almost his worshippers he was always fierce partisan with many friends and many enemies he has been lauded as the champion of the common man while criticized for his treatment of indians and for other matters according to early biographer james parton jackson was criticized by his contemporary alexis de tocqueville in democracy in america for flattering the dominant ideas of his time including the mistrust over the federal power for sometimes enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law in the th century jackson was written about by many admirers arthur schlesinger age of jackson depicts jackson as man of the people battling inequality and upper class tyranny from the to the robert remini published three volume biography of jackson followed by an abridged one volume study remini paints generally favorable portrait of jackson he contends that jacksonian democracy stretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workable as such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in american history populism progressivism the new and fair deals and the programs of the new frontier and great society however other th century writers such as richard hofstadter and bray hammond depict jackson as an advocate of the sort of laissez faire capitalism that benefits the rich and oppresses the poor jackson initiatives to deal with the conflicts between indians and american settlers has been source of controversy starting mainly around jackson came under sharp attack from historians on this issue howard zinn called him the most aggressive enemy of the indians in early american history and exterminator of indians in francis paul prucha argued that jackson removal of the five civilized tribes from the extremely hostile white environment in the old south to oklahoma probably saved their very existence similarly remini claims that if not for jackson policies the southern tribes would have been totally wiped out just like other tribes namely the yamasee mahican and narragansett which did not move brands observes that jackson reputation declined after the mid th century as his actions towards indians and african americans received new attention after the civil rights movement brand writes his unrepentant ownership of slaves marked him as one to be censured rather than praised further by the turn of the present st century it was scarcely an exaggeration to say that the one thing american schoolchildren learned about jackson was that he was the author of the trail of tears jackson was often hailed during his lifetime as the second george washington because while washington had fought for independence jackson confirmed it at new orleans and made the united states great world power over time however while the revolution has maintained reasonably strong presence in the public conscience memory of the battle of new orleans declined brands argues that once america had become military power it was easy to think that america had been destined for this role from the beginning still jackson performance in office has generally been ranked in the top half in public opinion polling his position in span poll dropped from th in to th in some associate this decline with the frequent praise jackson has received from sitting president donald trump who hung jackson official portrait in the oval office jackson has long been honored along with thomas jefferson in the jefferson jackson day fundraising dinners each year the dinner has been held by state democratic party organizations to honor the two men whom the party regards as its founders however due to the fact that both jefferson and jackson were slave owners as well as jackson indian removal policies many state party organizations have renamed the dinners portrayal on banknotes and stamps jackson portrait on obverse bill jackson has appeared on banknotes as far back as and extending into the st century his image has appeared on the and note most recently his image has appeared on the federal reserve note beginning in in treasury secretary jack lew announced his goal that by an image of harriet tubman would replace jackson depiction on the front side of the banknote and that an image of jackson would be placed on the reverse side though the final decision will be made by his successors jackson has appeared on several postage stamps he first appeared on an two cent stamp which is commonly referred to by collectors as the black jack due to the large portraiture of jackson on its face printed in pitch black during the american civil war the confederate government also issued two confederate postage stamps bearing jackson portrait one cent red stamp and the other cent green stamp both issued in memorials the tomb of andrew and rachel jackson located at the hermitage numerous counties and cities are named after him including the city of jacksonville in florida and north carolina the city of jackson in louisiana michigan mississippi missouri and tennessee jackson county in florida illinois mississippi missouri ohio and oregon and jackson parish in louisiana memorials to jackson include set of four identical equestrian statues by the sculptor clark mills in lafayette square washington in jackson square new orleans in nashville on the grounds of the tennessee state capitol and in jacksonville florida other equestrian statues of jackson have been erected elsewhere as in the state capitol grounds in raleigh north carolina that statue controversially identifies him as one of the presidents north carolina gave the nation and he is featured alongside james polk and andrew johnson both presidents born in north carolina there is bust of andrew jackson in plaza ferdinand vii in pensacola florida where he became the first governor of the florida territory in popular culture depictions jackson and his wife rachel were the main subjects of historical novel by irving stone the president lady which told the story of their lives up until rachel death the novel was the basis for the film of the same name starring charlton heston as jackson and susan hayward as rachel jackson has been supporting character in number of historical films and television productions

geologists in slight quandary despite the high concentration of geoscientists in the area courtesy of the oil industry there is only vague understanding of what underlies the city to the south side of the city coastal cliffs expose high grade metamorphic rocks of the grampian group to the south west and west are extensive granites intruded into similar high grade schists to the north the metamorphics are intruded by gabbroic complexes instead the small amount of geophysics done and occasional building related exposures combined with small exposures in the banks of the river don suggest that it is actually sited on an inlier of devonian old red sandstones and silts the outskirts of the city spread beyond the inferred limits of the outlier onto the surrounding metamorphic igneous complexes formed during the dalradian period approximately million years ago with sporadic areas of igneous diorite granites to be found such as that at the rubislaw quarry which was used to

the almoravid dynasty al murābiṭūn was an imperial berber muslim dynasty centered in morocco it established an empire in the th century that stretched over the western maghreb and al andalus founded by abdallah ibn yasin the almoravid capital was marrakesh city the ruling house founded in the dynasty originated among the lamtuna and the gudala nomadic berber tribes of the sahara traversing the territory between the draa the niger and the senegal rivers the almoravids were crucial in preventing the fall of al andalus to the iberian christian kingdoms when they decisively defeated coalition of the castilian and aragonese armies at the battle of sagrajas in this enabled them to control an empire that stretched kilometers mi north to south however the rule of the dynasty was relatively short lived the almoravids fell at the height of their power when they failed to stop the masmuda led rebellion initiated by ibn tumart as result their last king ishaq ibn ali was killed in marrakesh in april by the almohad caliphate who replaced them as ruling dynasty both in morocco and al andalus name the term almoravid comes from the arabic al murabitun which is the plural form of al murabit literally meaning one who is tying but figuratively meaning one who is ready for battle at fortress the term is related to the notion of ribat frontier monastery fortress through the root rabat to tie to unite or raabat to encamp the name almoravid was tied to school of malikite law called dar al murabitin founded in sus al aksa modern day morocco by scholar named waggag ibn zallu ibn zallu sent his student abdallah ibn yasin to preach malikite islam to the sanhaja berbers of the sous and adrar present day mauritania hence the name of the almoravids comes from the followers of the dar al murabitin the house of those who were bound together in the cause of god it is uncertain exactly when or why the almoravids acquired that appellation al bakri writing in before their apex already calls them the al murabitun but does not clarify the reasons for it writing three centuries later ibn abi zar suggested it was chosen early on by abdallah ibn yasin because upon finding resistance among the gudala berbers of adrar mauritania to his teaching he took handful of followers to erect makeshift ribat monastery fortress on an offshore island possibly tidra island in the bay of arguin ibn idhari wrote that the name was suggested by ibn yasin in the persevering in the fight sense to boost morale after particularly hard fought battle in the draa valley in which they had taken many losses whichever explanation is true it seems certain the appellation was chosen by the almoravids for themselves partly with the conscious goal of forestalling any tribal or ethnic identifications the name might be related to the ribat of waggag ibn zallu in the village of aglu near present day tiznit where the future almoravid spiritual leader abdallah ibn yasin got his initial training the th century moroccan biographer ibn al zayyat al tadili and qadi ayyad before him in the th century note that waggag learning center was called dar al murabitin the house of the almoravids and that might have inspired ibn yasin choice of name for the movement contemporaries frequently referred to them as the al mulathimun the veiled ones from litham arabic for veil the almoravids veiled themselves below the eyes with tagelmust custom they adapted from southern sanhaja berbers this can still be seen among the modern tuareg people but it was unusual further north although practical for the desert dust the almoravids insisted on wearing the veil everywhere as badge of foreignness in urban settings partly as way of emphasizing their puritan credentials it served as the uniform of the almoravids under their rule sumptuary laws forbade anybody else from wearing the veil thereby making it the distinctive dress of the ruling class in turn the succeeding almohads made point of mocking the almoravid veil as symbolic of effeminacy and decadence origins the berbers of the tamazgha in the early middle ages could be roughly classified into three major groups the zenata across the north the masmuda concentrated in central morocco and the sanhaja clustered in two areas the western part of the sahara and the hills of the eastern maghreb the eastern sanhaja included the kutama berbers who had been the base of the fatimid rise in the early th century and the zirid dynasty who ruled ifriqiya as vassals of the fatimids after the latter moved to egypt in the western sanhaja were divided into several tribes the gazzula and the lamta in the draa valley and the foothills of the anti atlas range further south encamped in the western sahara desert were the massufa the lamtuna and the banu warith and most southerly of all the gudala or judala in littoral mauritania down to the borderlands of the senegal river the western sanhaja had been converted to islam some time in the th century they were subsequently united in the th century and with the zeal of neophyte converts launched several campaigns against the sudanese pagan peoples of sub saharan africa under their king tinbarutan ibn usfayshar the sanhaja lamtuna erected or captured the citadel of awdaghust critical stop on the trans saharan trade route after the collapse of the sanhaja union awdagust passed over to the ghana empire and the trans saharan routes were taken over by the zenata maghrawa of sijilmassa the maghrawa also exploited this disunion to dislodge the sanhaja gazzula and lamta out of their pasturelands in the sous and draa valleys around the lamtuna chieftain abu abdallah muhammad ibn tifat alias tarsina tried to reunite the sanhaja desert tribes but his reign lasted less than three years around yahya ibn ibrahim chieftain of the gudala and brother in law of the late tarsina went on pilgrimage to mecca on his return he stopped by kairouan in ifriqiya where he met abu imran al fasi native of fes and jurist and scholar of the sunni maliki school at this time ifriqiya was in ferment the zirid ruler al muizz ibn badis was openly contemplating breaking with his shi ite fatimid overlords in cairo and the jurists of kairouan were agitating for him to do so within this heady atmosphere yahya and abu imran fell into conversation on the state of the faith in their western homelands and yahya expressed his disappointment at the lack of religious education and negligence of islamic law among his southern sanhaja people with abu imran recommendation yahya ibn ibrahim made his way to the ribat of waggag ibn zelu in the sous valley of southern morocco to seek out maliki teacher for his people waggag assigned him one of his residents abdallah ibn yasin abdallah ibn yasin was gazzula berber and probably convert rather than born muslim his name can be read as son of ya sin the title of the th sura of the qur an suggesting he had obliterated his family past and was re born of the holy book ibn yasin certainly had the ardor of puritan zealot his creed was mainly characterized by rigid formalism and strict adherence to the dictates of the qur an and the orthodox tradition chroniclers such as al bakri allege ibn yasin learning was superficial ibn yasin initial meetings with the gudala people went poorly as he had more ardor than depth ibn yasin arguments were disputed by his audience he responded to questioning with charges of apostasy and handed out harsh punishments for the slightest deviations the gudala soon had enough and expelled him almost immediately after the death of his protector yahya ibn ibrahim sometime in the ibn yasin however found more favorable reception among the neighboring lamtuna people probably sensing the useful organizing power of ibn yasin pious fervor the lamtuna chieftain yahya ibn umar al lamtuni invited the man to preach to his people the lamtuna leaders however kept ibn yasin on careful leash forging more productive partnership between them invoking stories of the early life of muhammad ibn yasin preached that conquest was necessary addendum to islamicization that it was not enough to merely adhere to god law but necessary to also destroy opposition to it in ibn yasin ideology anything and everything outside of islamic law could be characterized as opposition he identified tribalism in particular as an obstacle he believed it was not enough to urge his audiences to put aside their blood loyalties and ethnic differences and embrace the equality of all muslims under the sacred law it was necessary to make them do so for the lamtuna leadership this new ideology dovetailed with their long desire to refound the sanhaja union and recover their lost dominions in the early the lamtuna under the joint leadership of yahya ibn umar and abdallah ibn yasin soon calling themselves the al murabitin almoravids set out on campaign to bring their neighbors over to their cause conquests northern africa from the year the almoravids began to spread their religious way to the berber areas of the sahara and to the regions south of the desert after winning over the sanhaja berber tribe they quickly took control of the entire desert trade route seizing sijilmasa at the northern end in and aoudaghost at the southern end in yahya ibn umar was killed in battle in but abdullah ibn yasin whose influence as religious teacher was paramount named his brother abu bakr ibn umar as chief under him the almoravids soon began to spread their power beyond the desert and conquered the tribes of the atlas mountains they then came in contact with the berghouata berber tribal confederation who followed an islamic heresy preached by salih ibn tarif three centuries earlier the berghouata resisted abdullah ibn yasin was killed in battle with them in in krifla village near rommani morocco they were however completely conquered by abu bakr ibn umar and were forced to convert to orthodox islam abu bakr married noble and wealthy berber woman zaynab an nafzawiyyat who would become very influential in the development of the dynasty zaynab was the daughter of wealthy merchant from houara who was said to be from kairouan in abu bakr ibn umar made division of the power he had established handing over the more settled parts to his cousin yusuf ibn tashfin as viceroy and also assigning to him his favourite wife zaynab ibn umar kept the task of suppressing the revolts that had broken out in the desert when he returned to resume control he found his cousin too powerful to be superseded in november abu bakr was killed in battle according to oral tradition by an arrow while fighting in the historic region of the sudan yusuf ibn tashfin had in the meantime brought the large area of what is now known as morocco western sahara and mauritania into complete subjection in he founded the city of marrakech in he conquered the kingdom of tlemcen in modern day algeria and founded the present city of that name his rule extending as far east as oran ghana empire and the southern wing according to arab tradition the almoravids conquered the ghana empire sometime around ce an example of this tradition is the record of historian ibn khaldun who cited shaykh uthman the faqih of ghana writing in according to this source the almoravids weakened ghana and collected tribute from the sudan to the extent that the authority of the rulers of ghana dwindled away and they were subjugated and absorbed by the susu neighboring people of the sudan traditions in mali related that the soso attacked and took over mali as well and the ruler of the soso sumaouro kanté took over the land however criticism from conrad and fisher argued that the notion of any almoravid military conquest at its core is merely perpetuated folklore derived from or naive reliance on arabic sources according to professor timothy insoll the archaeology of ancient ghana simply does not show the signs of rapid change and destruction that would be associated with any almoravid era military conquests dierke lange agreed with the original military incursion theory but argues that this doesn preclude almoravid political agitation claiming that the main factor of the demise of ghana empire owed much to the latter according to lange the almoravid religious influence was gradual and not heavily involved in military strife there the almoravids increased in power by marrying among the nation nobility lange attributes the decline of ancient ghana to numerous unrelated factors only one of which can be likely attributable to internal dynastic struggles that were instigated by almoravid influence and islamic pressures but devoid of military conversion and conquest this interpretation of events has been disputed by later scholars like sheryl burkhalter who argued that whatever the nature of the conquest in the south of the sahara the influence and success of the almoravid movement in securing west african gold and circulating it widely necessitated high degree of political control the traditional position says that the ensuing war with the almoravids pushed ghana over the edge ending the kingdom position as commercial and military power by it collapsed into tribal groups and chieftaincies some of which later assimilated into the almoravids while others founded the mali empire the arab geographer al zuhri wrote that the almoravids ended ibadism in tadmekka in and that abu bakr arrived at the mountain of gold in the deep south after the death of abu bakr the confederation of berber tribes in the sahara was divided between the descendants of abu bakr and his brother yahya and would have lost control of ghana sheryl burkhalter suggests that abu bakr son yahya was the leader of the almoravid expedition that conquered ghana in and that the almoravids would have survived the loss of ghana and the defeat in the maghreb by the almohads and would have ruled the sahara until the end of the th century southern iberia and the northern wing almoravid gold dinar coin from seville spain british museum the almoravid gold dinar would set the standard of the iberian maravedi in yusuf ibn tashfin was invited by the muslim taifa princes of al andalus in the iberian peninsula to defend their territories from the encroachment of alfonso vi king of león and castile in that year yusuf ibn tashfin crossed the strait of gibraltar to algeciras and defeated castile at the battle of az zallaqah battle of sagrajas he was prevented from following up his victory by trouble in africa which he chose to settle in person he returned to iberia in avowedly for the purpose of annexing the taifa principalities of iberia he was supported by most of the iberian people who were discontented with the heavy taxation imposed upon them by their spendthrift rulers their religious teachers as well as others in the east most notably al ghazali in persia and al tartushi in egypt who was himself an iberian by birth from tortosa detested the taifa rulers for their religious indifference the clerics issued fatwa non binding legal opinion that yusuf was of sound morals and had the religious right to dethrone the rulers whom he saw as heterodox in their faith by yusuf had annexed most of the major taifas with the exception of the one at saragossa the almoravids were victorious at the battle of consuegra during which the son of el cid diego rodríguez perished alfonso with some leónese retreated into the castle of consuegra which was besieged for eight days until the almoravids withdrew to the south after friendly correspondence with the caliph at baghdad whom he acknowledged as amir al mu minin commander of the faithful yusuf ibn tashfin in assumed the title of amir al muslimin commander of the muslims he died in when he was reputed to have reached the age of the almoravid power was at its height at yusuf death the moorish empire then included all of northwest africa as far eastward as algiers and all of iberia south of the tagus and as far eastward as the mouth of the ebro and including the balearic islands in tamim al yusuf defeated the kingdom of castile at the battle of uclés yusuf did not reconquer much territory from the christian kingdoms except that of valencia but he did hinder the progress of the christian reconquista by uniting al andalus in at the battle of fraga the almoravids dynasty was victorious and even succeeded in slaying alfonso of aragon in the battle decline three years afterwards under yusuf son and successor ali ibn yusuf sintra and santarém were added and he invaded iberia again in and but the tide had turned as the french had assisted the aragonese to recover zaragoza in ali ibn yusuf was defeated by alfonso vii of león and in the battle of ourique by afonso of portugal who thereby won his crown lisbon was conquered by the portuguese in according to some scholars ali ibn yusuf was new generation of leadership that had forgotten the desert life for the comforts of the city he was defeated by the combined action of his christian foes in iberia and the agitation of almohads the muwahhids in morocco after ali ibn yusuf death in his son tashfin ibn ali lost ground rapidly before the almohads in he was killed in fall from precipice while attempting to escape after defeat near oran his two successors were ibrahim ibn tashfin and ishaq ibn ali but their reigns were short the conquest of the city of marrakech by the almohads in marked the fall of the dynasty though fragments of the almoravids the banu ghaniya continued to struggle in the balearic islands and finally in tunisia military organization abdallah ibn yassin imposed very strict discipline measures on his forces for every breach of his laws the almoravids first military leader yahya ibn umar al lamtuni gave them good military organization their main force was infantry armed with javelins in the front ranks and pikes behind which formed into phalanx and was supported by camelmen and horsemen on the flanks they also had flag carrier at the front who guided the forces behind him when the flag was upright the combatants behind would stand and when it was turned down they would sit al bakri reports that while in combat the almoravids did not pursue those who fled in front of them their fighting was intense and they did not retreat when disadvantaged by an advancing opposing force they preferred death over defeat these characteristics were possibly unusual at the time legends after the death of el cid christian chronicles reported legend of turkish woman leading band of amazons black female archers this legend was possibly inspired by the ominous veils on the faces of the warriors and their dark skin colored blue by the indigo of their robes

the age of consent is the age at which person is considered to be legally competent to consent to sexual acts and is thus the minimum age of person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity the distinguishing aspect of the age of consent laws is that the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim and his or her sex partner is regarded as the offender unless both are underage the purpose of setting an age of consent is to protect an underage person from sexual advances the term age of consent rarely appears in legal statutes generally law will instead establish the age below which it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with that person it has sometimes been used with other meanings such as the age at which person becomes competent to consent to marriage but the meaning given above is the one now generally understood it should not be confused with the age of majority age of criminal responsibility the voting age the drinking age the driving age etc age of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range to the laws may also vary by the type of sexual act the gender of the participants or other considerations such as involving position of trust some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other rather than single age charges and penalties resulting from breach of these laws may range from misdemeanor such as corruption of minor to what is popularly called statutory rape which is considered equivalent to rape both in severity and sentencing there are many grey areas in this area of law some regarding unspecific and untried legislation others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes and others due to conflicts between federal and state laws these factors all make age of consent an often confusing subject and topic of highly charged debates history and social attitudes traditional attitudes in traditional societies the age of consent for sexual union was matter for the family to decide or tribal custom in most cases this coincided with signs of puberty menstruation for woman and pubic hair for man the ancient greek poet hesiod in works and days bc suggests that man should marry around the age of thirty and that he should take wife who is five years past puberty reliable data for ages at marriage is scarce in england for example the only reliable data in the early modern period comes from property records made after death not only were the records relatively rare but not all bothered to record the participants ages and it seems that the more complete the records are the more likely they are to reveal young marriages modern historians have sometimes shown reluctance to accept evidence of young ages of marriage dismissing it as misreading by later copier of the records in the th century gratian the influential founder of canon law in medieval europe accepted age of puberty for marriage to be around twelve for girls and around for boys but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if both children were older than seven years of age there were authorities that said that consent could take place earlier marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty or if they had already consummated the marriage judges sometimes honored marriages based on mutual consent at ages younger than seven in contrast to established canon there are recorded marriages of two and three year olds the first recorded age of consent law dates from in england as part of its provisions on rape the statute of westminster made it misdemeanor to ravish maiden within age whether with or without her consent the phrase within age was later interpreted by jurist sir edward coke as meaning the age of marriage which at the time was years of age the american colonies followed the english tradition and the law was more of guide for example mary hathaway virginia was only when she was married to william williams sir edward coke england th century made it clear that the marriage of girls under was normal and the age at which girl who was wife was eligible for dower from her husband estate was even though her husband be only four years old in the th century small number of italian and german states set the minimum age for sexual intercourse for girls setting it at years towards the end of the th century other european countries also began to enact similar laws the first french constitution of established the minimum age at years portugal spain denmark and the swiss cantons initially set the minimum age at years age of consent laws were historically difficult to follow and enforce legal norms based on age were not in general common until the th century because clear proof of exact age and precise date of birth were often unavailable in christian societies sex outside marriage was forbidden older children were often punished themselves for being complicit in sexual interaction with an adult until the late th century there was little understanding of childhood as concept and children were seen as little adults indeed prior to the th century there was virtually no notion of childhood at all western christianity also deemed that children were born into the original sin and as such were perceived as inherently immoral children had very few rights and were considered the chattel of the father from the late th century and especially in the th century attitudes started to change by the mid th century there was increased concern over child sexual abuse reforms in the th and th century general shift in social and legal attitudes toward issues of sex occurred during the modern era attitudes on the appropriate age of permission for females to engage in sexual activity drifted toward adulthood while ages from to were typically regarded as acceptable ages for sexual consent in western countries during the mid th century by the end of the th century changing attitudes towards sexuality and childhood resulted in the raising of the age of consent several articles written by investigative journalist william thomas stead in the late th century on the issue of child prostitution in london led to public outrage and ultimately to the raising of the age of consent to the english common law had traditionally set the age of consent within the range of to but in the age was raised to early feminists of the social purity movement such as josephine butler and others instrumental in securing the repeal of the contagious diseases acts began to turn towards the problem of child prostitution by the end of the sensational media revelations about the scourge of child prostitution in london in the then caused outrage among the respectable middle classes leading to pressure for the age of consent to be raised again the investigative journalist william thomas stead of the pall mall gazette was pivotal in exposing the problem of child prostitution in the london underworld through publicity stunt in he purchased one victim eliza armstrong the year old daughter of chimney sweep for five pounds and took her to brothel where she was drugged he then published series of four exposés entitled the maiden tribute of modern babylon which shocked its readers with tales of child prostitution and the abduction procurement and sale of young english virgins to continental pleasure palaces the maiden tribute was an instant sensation with the reading public and victorian society was thrown into an uproar about prostitution fearing riots on national scale the home secretary sir william harcourt pleaded in vain with stead to cease publication of the articles wide variety of reform groups held protest meetings and marched together to hyde park demanding that the age of consent be raised the government was forced to propose the criminal law amendment act which raised the age of consent from to and clamped down on prostitution in the united states as late as the most states set the minimum age at in delaware it was in inspired by the maiden tribute articles female reformers in the us initiated their own campaign which petitioned legislators to raise the legal minimum age to at least with the ultimate goal to raise the age to the campaign was successful with almost all states raising the minimum age to years by in france portugal denmark and the swiss cantons and other countries the minimum age was raised to between and years in the following decades though the original arguments for raising the age of consent were based on morality since then the raison être of the laws has changed to child welfare and so called right to childhood or innocence in france under the napoleonic code the age of consent was set in at and was raised to in it was increased to in in spain it was set in at puberty age and changed to in which was kept until when it became and in it was raised to st century and present day situation in the st century concerns about child sex tourism and commercial sexual exploitation of children gained international prominence and have resulted in legislative changes in several jurisdictions as well as in the adoption of several international instruments the council of europe convention on the protection of children against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse lanzarote october and the european union directive eu of the european parliament and of the council of december on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography were adopted the optional protocol on the sale of children child prostitution and child pornography came into force in the protocol to prevent suppress and punish trafficking in persons especially women and children which came into force in prohibits commercial sexual exploitation of children the council of europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings which came into force in also deals with commercial sexual exploitation of children several western countries have raised their ages of consent recently these include canada in from to and in europe iceland in from to lithuania in from to croatia in from to and spain in from to the international criminal court statute does not provide specific age of consent in its rape sexual violence statute but makes reference to sexual acts committed against persons incapable of giving genuine consent and the explicative footnote states it is understood that person may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural induced or age related incapacity see note law sexual relations with person under the age of consent is crime in most countries jurisdictions use variety of terms for the offense including child sexual abuse statutory rape illegal carnal knowledge corruption of minor besides others the enforcement practices of age of consent laws vary depending on the social sensibilities of the particular culture see above often enforcement is not exercised to the letter of the law with legal action being taken only when sufficiently socially unacceptable age gap exists between the two individuals or if the perpetrator is in position of power over the minor teacher minister or doctor the sex of each participant can also influence perceptions of an individual guilt and therefore enforcement age the threshold age for engaging in sexual activity varies between jurisdictions see below most jurisdictions have set fixed age of consent however some jurisdictions permit sex with person after their puberty such as yemen but only in marriage ages can also vary based on the type of calendar used such as the lunar calendar how birth dates in leap years are handled or even the method by which birth date is calculated defenses and exceptions the age of consent is legal barrier to the minor ability to consent and therefore obtaining consent is not in general defense to having sexual relations with person under the prescribed age for example reasonable belief that the victim is over the age of consent in some jurisdictions it is defense if the accused can show that he or she reasonably believed the victim was over the age of consent however where such defense is provided it normally applies only when the victim is close to the age of consent or the accused can show due diligence in determining the age of the victim an underage person who used fake identification document claiming to be of legal age marriage in various jurisdictions age of consent laws do not apply if the parties are legally married to each other some jurisdictions have laws explicitly allowing sexual acts with minors under the age of consent if their partner is close in age to them for instance in canada the age of consent is but there are two close in age exemptions sex with minors aged is permitted if the partner is less than five years older and sex with minors aged is permitted if the partner is less than two years older other countries state that the sexual conduct with the minor is not to be punished if the partners are of similar age and development for instance the age of consent in finland is but the law states that the act will not be punished if there is no great difference in the ages or the mental and physical maturity of the persons involved another approach takes the form of stipulation that sexual intercourse between minor and an adult is legal under the condition that the latter does not exceed certain age for example the age of consent in the us state of delaware is but it is allowed for teenagers aged and to engage in sexual intercourse as long as the older partner is younger than in slovenia the age of consent is but the law requires that there be marked discrepancy between the maturity of the perpetrator and that of the victim homosexual and heterosexual age discrepancies some jurisdictions such as the bahamas bermuda cayman islands chile paraguay and suriname have higher age of consent for same sex sexual activity in both the united kingdom and western australia for example the age of consent was originally for same sex sexual activity between males with no laws regarding lesbian sexual activities while it was for heterosexual sexual activity this is no longer the case however such discrepancies are increasingly being challenged in canada the age of consent for anal sex is officially higher at years compared with years for vaginal and oral sex in the canadian provinces of british columbia nova scotia alberta ontario and quebec this discrepancy has been declared by courts gender age differentials in some jurisdictions such as indonesia there are different ages of consent for heterosexual sexual activity that are based on the gender of each person in countries where there are gender age differentials the age of consent may be higher for girls for example in papua new guinea where the age of consent for heterosexual sex is for girls and for boys or they may be higher for males such as in indonesia where males must be years old and females must be years old there are also numerous jurisdictions such as kuwait and the palestinian territories in which marriage laws govern the gender age differential in these jurisdictions it is illegal to have sexual intercourse outside of marriage so the de facto age of consent is the marriageable age in kuwait this means that boys must be at least and girls at least years old position of authority trust in most jurisdictions where the age of consent is below such as england and wales in cases where person aged or older is in position of trust over person under the age of consent usually rises to or higher examples of such positions of trust include relationships between teachers and students for example in england and wales the age of consent is but if the person is student of the older person it becomes circumstances of the relationship in several jurisdictions it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with person under certain age under certain circumstances regarding the relationship in question such as if it involves taking advantage of or corrupting the morals of the young person for example while the age of consent is in germany and in canada it is illegal in both countries to engage in sexual activity with person under if the activity exploits the younger person another example is in mexico where there is crime called estupro defined as sexual activity with person over the age of consent but under certain age limit generally in which consent of the younger person was obtained through seduction and or deceit in pennsylvania the age of consent is officially but if the older partner is or older he she may still be prosecuted for corruption of minors if he she corrupts or tends to corrupt the morals of the younger person some countries have age of consent laws which apply not only to acts committed within the country but also to those committed by its citizens or inhabitants while they are on foreign soil for example federal united states law bans sexual activity by its citizens with foreigners or with citizens from another state if the partner is under and the activity is illegal under the federal state or local law this applies in cases where any of the partners travels into or out of the united states or from one state into another for the purpose of an illegal sexual encounter other issues gender of participants there is debate as to whether the gender of those involved should lead to different treatment of the sexual encounter in law or in practice traditionally age of consent laws regarding vaginal intercourse were often meant to protect the chastity of unmarried girls many feminists and social campaigners in the have objected to the social importance of virginity and have also attempted to change the stereotypes of female passivity and male aggression demanding that the law protect children from exploitation regardless of their gender rather than dealing with concerns of chastity this has led to gender neutral laws in many jurisdictions on the other hand there is an opposing view which argues that the act of vaginal intercourse is an unequal act for males and females due to issues such as pregnancy increased risk of stds and risk of physical injury if the girl is too young and not physically ready in the us in michael superior ct it was ruled that the double standard of offering more legal protection to girls is valid because the equal protection clause does not mean that the physiological differences between men and women must be disregarded traditionally many age of consent laws dealt primarily with men engaging in sexual acts with underage girls and boys the latter acts often falling under sodomy and buggery laws this means that in some legal systems women having sexual contact with underage youth were rarely acknowledged for example until in the uk before the sexual offences amendment act there was no statutory age of consent for lesbian sex in new zealand before there were no age of consent laws dealing with women having sex with underage boys previously in fiji male offenders of child sexual abuse could receive up to life imprisonment whilst female offenders would receive up to seven years situations like these have been attributed to societal views on traditional gender roles and to constructs of male sexuality and female sexuality according to martellozzo viewing females as perpetrators of sexual abuse goes against every stereotype that society has of women women as mothers and caregivers and not as people who abuse and harm alissa nutting argues that women are not acknowledged as perpetrators of sex crimes because society does not accept that women have an autonomous sexuality of their own marriage and the age of consent the age at which person can be legally married can differ from the age of consent in jurisdictions where the marriageable age is lower than the age of consent those laws usually override the age of consent laws in the case of married couple where one or both partners are below the age of consent some jurisdictions prohibit all sex outside of marriage irrespective of age as in the case of yemen prostitution in many countries there are specific laws dealing with child prostitution pornography and jailbait images in some countries states or other jurisdictions the age of consent may be lower than the age at which person can appear in pornographic images and films in many jurisdictions the minimum age for participation and even viewing such material is as such in some jurisdictions films and images showing individuals under the age of but above the age of consent that meet the legal definition of child pornography are prohibited despite the fact that the sexual acts depicted are legal to engage in otherwise under that jurisdiction age of consent laws in those cases it is only the filming of the sex act that is the crime as the act itself would not be considered sex crime for example in the united states under federal law it is crime to film minors below in sexual acts even in states where the age of consent is below in those states charges such as child pornography can be used to prosecute someone having sex with minor who could not be otherwise be prosecuted for statutory rape provided they filmed or photographed the act jailbait images can be differentiated from child pornography as they do not feature minors before the onset of puberty nor do they contain nudity the images are however usually sexualized often featuring tween or young teen girls in bikinis skirts underwear or lingerie whether or not these images are legal is debated when questioned regarding their legality legal analyst jeffrey toobin stated he thought it was not illegal though legal expert sunny hostin was more skeptical describing jailbait images as borderline child pornography which may be illegal health the human immune system continues to develop after puberty the age of exposure has an influence upon if the immune system can fend off infections in general and this is also true in the case of some sexually transmitted diseases for example risk factor for hpv strains causing genital warts is sexual debut at young age if this extends to the cancer causing strains then sexual debut at young age would potentially also increase risk of persistence of hpv infections that cause the very hpv induced cancers that are being diagnosed in spiking numbers of relatively young people initiatives to change the age of consent age of consent reform refers to the efforts of some individuals or groups for different reasons to alter or abolish age of consent laws these efforts advocate five main positions introductions of close in age exceptions change in the way that age of

amati is the last name of family of italian violin makers who lived at cremona from about to their importance is considered equal to those of the bergonzi guarneri and stradivari families today violins created by nicolò amati are valued at around family members andrea amati andrea amati designed and created the violin viola and cello known as the violin family he standardized the basic form shape size materials and method of construction makers from nearby brescia experimented such as gasparo da salò micheli zanetto and pellegrino but it was andrea amati in cremona italy who gave the modern violin family their definitive profile the first violin was ordered by lorenzo de medici in his letter to amati stated the instrument was to be made of the highest quality materials like that of lute but simple to play the first violin was intended to be used by illiterate musicians so the design was simple and it was easy to play what became of this first violin is not known number of his instruments survived for some time dating between amati made the first cello called the king in and the largest number these are from set for an entire orchestra of ordered by catherine de médicis the regent queen of france and bore hand painted royal french decorations in gold including the motto and coat of arms of her son charles ix of france of these instruments ordered amati created violins of two sizes violas of two sizes and large sized cellos they were in use until the french revolution of and only of these instruments survived his work is marked by selection of the finest materials great elegance in execution soft clear amber soft translucent varnish and an in depth use of acoustic and geometrical principles in design antonio and girolamo amati andrea amati was succeeded by his sons antonio amati and girolamo amati the brothers amati as they were known implemented far reaching innovations in design including the perfection of the shape of the holes they are also thought to have pioneered the modern alto format of viola in contrast to older tenor violas but the widespread belief that they were the first ones to do so is incorrect given that gasparo da salo made violas ranging from altos of cm to tenors of cm nicolo amati nicolò amati december april was the son of girolamo amati he was the most eminent of the family he improved the model adopted by the rest of the amatis and produced instruments capable of yielding greater power of tone his pattern was unusually small but he also made wider model now known as the grand amati which have become his most sought after violins of his pupils the most famous were antonio stradivari and andrea guarneri the first of the guarneri family of violin makers there is much controversy regarding the apprenticeship of antonio stradivari while the label on stradivari first known violin states that he was pupil of amati the validity of his statement is questioned girolamo amati hieronymus ii the last maker of the family was nicolò son girolamo amati known as hieronymus ii february february although he improved on the arching of his father instruments by and large they are inferior and no match for the greatest

memory most of the sutras of the sutta pitaka are attributed to his recollection of the buddha teachings during the first buddhist council for that reason he was known as the guardian of the dharma role in the pali canon according to buddhist tradition every buddha in the past and to come will have two chief disciples and one attendant during his ministry in the case of gautama buddha the pair of chief disciples were sariputta and maudgalyayana and the attendant was ānanda the word ānanda means bliss in pali sanskrit as well as other indian languages it is popular name in india and south east asia especially indonesia in the kannakatthala sutta mn ananda is identified with the meaning of his name then king pasenadi kosala said to the blessed one lord what is the name of this monk his name is ananda great king what joy he is what true joy ānanda was devoted to the buddha tradition says that he was the first cousin of the buddha by their fathers the mahavastu states that ananda mother name was mrigi little deer who is named in the kanjur and sanghabedavastu as one of gautama harem wives prior to his renunciation pointing to the possibility that ananda was in fact the buddha son in the twentieth year of the buddha ministry ananda became the buddha personal attendant accompanying him on most of his wanderings and taking the part of interlocutor in many of the recorded dialogues he is the subject of special panegyric delivered by the buddha just before the buddha parinibbana the mahaparinibbana sutta dn it is panegyric for man who is kindly unselfish popular and thoughtful toward others in the long list of the disciples given in the anguttara nikaya xiv where each of them is declared to be prime in some quality ānanda is mentioned five times more often than any other he was named prime in conduct in service to others and in power of memory the buddha sometimes asked ānanda to substitute for him as teacher and then later stated that he himself would not have presented the teachings in any other way the buddhist canon attributes the inclusion of women in the early sangha monastic order to ānanda the buddha conceded and permitted his step mother mahapajapati to be ordained as bhikkhuni only after ananda prevailed upon the buddha to publicly recognize women as being equal to men in possessing the potential for awakening following the death of the buddha ananda was criticized by the members of the sangha for having enabled women to join the monastic order the first council because he attended the buddha personally and often traveled with him ānanda overheard and memorized many of the discourses the buddha delivered to various audiences therefore he is often referred to as the disciple of the buddha who heard much at the first buddhist council convened shortly after the buddha died ananda was called upon to recite many of the discourses that later became the sutta pitaka of the pāli canon despite his long association with and close proximity to the buddha ananda was only stream winner prior to the buddha death however buddha said that the purity of his heart was so great that should ananda die without being fully liberated he would be king of the gods seven times because of the purity of his heart or be king of the indian subcontinent seven times but ananda will experience final liberation in this very life an prior to the first buddhist council it was proposed that ananda not be permitted to attend on the grounds that he was not yet an arahant according to legend this prompted ananda to focus his efforts on the attainment of nibbana and he was able to reach the specified level of attainment before the convening of the conclave in contrast to most of the figures depicted in the pāli canon ananda is presented as an imperfect if sympathetic figure he mourns the deaths of both sariputta with whom he enjoyed close friendship and the buddha verse of the theragatha reveals his loneliness and isolation following the parinirvana salvation demise of the buddha in the zen tradition ananda is considered to be the second indian patriarch he is often depicted with the buddha alongside mahakashyapa the first indian

that the best measure of royal grant is its being immeasurable his new institutions altered the relations between the monarchs and the hungarian lords during the previous two centuries lord status primarily depended on the income he received for his services to the monarch after the introduction of the new institutions their inheritable estates yielded sufficient revenues this policy also diminished the funds upon which the authority of the ispáns or heads of the countieswho were appointed by the monarchshad been based during his reign andrew was intensely interested in the internal

revenues had significantly diminished upon the advice of the treasurer denis son of ampud andrew imposed new taxes and farmed out royal income from minting salt trade and custom duties the yearly

illuminated chronicle in july the newly elected pope honorius iii once again called upon andrew to fulfill his father vow to lead crusade andrew who had postponed the crusade at least three times in and finally agreed steven runciman tibor almási and other modern historians say that andrew hoped that his decision would increase his likelihood of being elected as latin emperor of constantinople because his wife uncle emperor henry had died in june according to letter written by pope honorius in envoys from the latin empire had actually informed andrew that they planned to elect either him or his father in law peter of courtenay as emperor the barons of the latin empire elected peter of courtenay in the summer of andrew sold and mortgaged royal estates to finance his campaign which became part of the wider fifth crusade he renounced his claim to zadar in favor of the republic of venice so that he could secure shipping for his army he entrusted hungary to archbishop john of esztergom and gave croatia and dalmatia to pontius de cruce the templar prior of vrana in july andrew departed from zagreb accompanied by leopold vi of austria and otto duke of merania his army was so largeat least mounted soldiers and uncountable infantrymenthat most of it stayed behind when andrew and his men embarked in split two months later the ships transported them to acre where they landed in october the leaders of the crusade included john of brienne king of jerusalem leopold of austria the grand masters of the hospitallers the templars and the teutonic knights they held war council in acre with andrew leading the meeting in early november the crusaders launched campaign for the jordan river forcing al adil sultan of egypt to withdraw without fighting the crusaders then pillaged beisan after the crusaders returned to acre andrew did not participate in any other military actions instead he was collecting relics including water jug allegedly used at the marriage at cana the heads of saint stephen and margaret the virgin the right hands of the apostles thomas and bartholomew and part of aaron rod if thomas the archdeacon report of certain evil and audacious men in acre who treacherously passed him poisoned drink is reliable andrew inactivity was because of illness andrew decided to return home at the very beginning of even though raoul of merencourt latin patriarch of jerusalem threatened him with excommunication andrew first visited tripoli and participated in the marriage of bohemond iv of antioch and melisende of lusignan on january from tripoli he travelled to cilicia where he and leo of armenia betrothed andrew youngest son andrew and leo daughter isabella andrew proceeded through the seldjuk sultanate of rum before arriving in nicaea now iznik turkey his cousins the sons of his uncle géza attacked him when he was in nicaea he arranged the marriage of his oldest son béla to maria laskarina daughter of emperor theodore laskaris when he arrived in bulgaria andrew was detained until he gave full surety that his daughter would be united in marriage to ivan asen ii of bulgaria according to thomas the archdeacon andrew returned to hungary in late andrew crusade had achieved nothing and brought him no honor according to historian thomas van cleve oliver of padernborn james of vitry and other th century authors blamed andrew for the failure of crusade golden bull the golden bull of when he returned to hungary andrew complained to pope honorius that his kingdom was in miserable and destroyed state deprived of all of its revenues group of barons had even expelled archbishop john from hungary andrew was in massive debt because of his crusade which forced him to impose extraordinarily high taxes and debase coinage in or mstislav mstislavich invaded halych and captured andrew son coloman andrew compromised with mstislavich coloman was released and andrew youngest son and namesake was betrothed to mstislavich daughter in group of lords persuaded andrew to make his eldest son béla the duke of croatia dalmatia and slavonia andrew employed jews and muslims to administer royal revenues which caused discord between andrew and the holy see starting in the early pope honorius urged andrew and queen yolanda to prohibit muslims from employing christians andrew confirmed the privileges of clergymen including their exemption from taxes and their right to be exclusively judged by church courts but also prohibited the consecration of udvornici castle folk and other serfs in early however new conflict emerged between andrew and the holy see after he persuaded béla to separate from his wife maria laskarina an immense crowd approached andrew around june demanding grave and unjust things according to letter of pope honorius actually the royal servantswho were landowners directly subject to the monarch power and obliged to fight in the royal armyassembled forcing andrew to dismiss julius kán and his other officials andrew was also forced issue royal charter the golden bull of the charter summarized the liberties of the royal servants including their exemption from taxes and the jurisdiction of the ispáns the last clause of the golden bull authorized the bishops as well as the other barons and nobles of the realm singularly and in common to resist the monarch if he did not honor the provisions of the charter the golden bull clearly distinguished the royal servants from the king other subjects which led to the rise of the hungarian nobility the golden bull is commonly compared with england magna carta similar charter which was sealed few years earlier in significant difference between them is that in england the settlement strengthened the position of all the royal subjects but in hungary the aristocracy came to dominate both the crown and the lower orders conflicts with his son and the church andrew discharged palatine theodore csanád and restored julius kán in the second half of the following year pope honorius urged andrew to launch new crusade if the report of the continuatio is reliable andrew took the cross to show that he intended launch new crusade but no other sources

expanding his suzerainty over the cumans who inhabited the lands east of the carpathian mountains andrew launched campaign against mstislav mstislavich in because the latter refused to grant halych to andrew youngest son despite previous compromise andrew besieged and captured przemyśl terebovl and other fortresses in halych however his troops were routed at kremenets and zvenigorod forcing him to withdraw despite his victories mstislavich ceded halych to andrew son in early heroes square in budapest in andrew authorized his son béla to revise his previous land grants pope honorius also supported béla efforts béla confiscated the domains of two noblemen simon kacsics and bánk bár kalán who had taken part in the conspiracy to murder queen gertrude in upon béla proposal andrew confirmed the privileges of the cuman chieftains who had subjected themselves to béla robert archbishop of esztergom made complaint about andrew to the holy see because andrew continued to employ jews and muslims pope gregory ix authorized the archbishop to perform acts of religious censure to persuade andrew to dismiss his non christian officials under duress andrew issued new golden bull in which confirmed that muslims were banned from employment and empowered the archbishop of esztergom to excommunicate the king if he failed to honor the provisions of the new golden bull in the second half of the year andrew invaded halych and restored his youngest son andrew to the throne archbishop robert excommunicated palatine denis and put hungary under an interdict on february because the employment of jews and muslims continued despite the golden bull of since the archbishop accused the muslims of persuading andrew to seize church property andrew restored properties to the archbishop who soon suspended the interdict upon andrew demand pope gregory sent cardinal giacomo pecoraria as his legate to hungary and promised that nobody would be excommunicated without the pope special authorization although andrew departed for halych to support his youngest son in fight against daniel romanivich he continued his negotiations with the papal legate on august in the forests of bereg he vowed that

allan ramsay an enquiry concerning human understanding is book by the scottish empiricist philosopher david hume published in english in it was revision of an earlier effort hume treatise of human nature published anonymously in london in hume was disappointed with the reception of the treatise which fell dead born from the press as he put it and so tried again to disseminate his more developed ideas to the public by writing shorter and more polemical work the end product of his labours was the enquiry the enquiry dispensed with much of the material from the treatise in favor of clarifying and emphasizing its most important aspects for example hume views on personal identity do not appear however more vital propositions such as hume argument for the role of habit in theory of knowledge are retained this book has proven highly influential both in the years that would immediately follow and today immanuel kant points to it as the book which woke him from his self described dogmatic slumber the enquiry is widely regarded as classic in modern philosophical literature summary the argument of the enquiry proceeds by series of incremental steps separated into chapters which logically succeed one another after expounding his epistemology hume explains how to apply his principles to specific topics empirical epistemology of the different species of philosophy in the first section of the enquiry hume provides rough introduction to philosophy as whole for hume philosophy can be split into two general parts natural philosophy and the philosophy of human nature or as he calls it moral philosophy the latter investigates both actions and thoughts he emphasizes in this section by way of warning that philosophers with nuanced thoughts will likely be cast aside in favor of those whose conclusions more intuitively match popular opinion however he insists precision helps art and craft of all kinds including the craft of philosophy of the origin of ideas next hume discusses the distinction between impressions and ideas by impressions he means sensations while by ideas he means memories and imaginings according to hume the difference between the two is that ideas are less vivacious than impressions for example the idea of the taste of an orange is far inferior to the impression or sensation of actually eating one writing within the tradition of empiricism he argues that impressions are the source of all ideas hume accepts that ideas may be either the product of mere sensation or of the imagination working in conjunction with sensation according to hume the creative faculty makes use of at least four mental operations which produce imaginings out of sense impressions these operations are compounding or the addition of one idea onto another such as horn on horse to create unicorn transposing or the substitution of one part of thing with the part from another such as with the body of man upon horse to make centaur augmenting as with the case of giant whose size has been augmented and diminishing as with lilliputians whose size has been diminished hume in later chapter he also mentions the operations of mixing separating and dividing hume fig the missing shade of blue however hume admits that there is one objection to his account the problem of the missing shade of blue in this thought experiment he asks us to imagine man who has experienced every shade of blue except for one see fig he predicts that this man will be able to divine the color of this particular shade of blue despite the fact that he has never experienced it this seems to pose serious problem for the empirical account though hume brushes it aside as an exceptional case by stating that one may experience novel idea that itself is derived from combinations of previous impressions hume of the association of ideas in this chapter hume discusses how thoughts tend to come in sequences as in trains of thought he explains that there are at least three kinds of associations between ideas resemblance contiguity in space time and cause and effect he argues that there must be some universal principle that must account for the various sorts of connections that exist between ideas however he does not immediately show what this principle might be hume sceptical doubts concerning the operations of the understanding in two parts in the first part hume discusses how the objects of inquiry are either relations of ideas or matters of fact which is roughly the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions the former he tells the reader are proved by demonstration while the latter are given through experience hume in explaining how matters of fact are entirely product of experience he dismisses the notion that they may be arrived at through priori reasoning for hume every effect only follows its cause arbitrarily they are entirely distinct from one another hume in part two hume inquires into how anyone can justifiably believe that experience yields any conclusions about the world when it is asked what is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter of fact the proper answer seems to be that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect when again it is asked what is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation it may be replied in one word experience but if we still carry on our sifting humor and ask what is the foundation of all conclusions from experience this implies new question which may be of more difficult solution and explication hume he shows how satisfying argument for the validity of experience can be based neither on demonstration since it implies no contradiction that the course of nature may change nor experience since that would be circular argument hume here he is describing what would become known as the problem of induction sceptical solution of these doubts in two parts for hume we assume that experience tells us something about the world because of habit or custom which human nature forces us to take seriously this is also presumably the principle that organizes the connections between ideas indeed one of the many famous passages of the inquiry was on the topic of the incorrigibility of human custom in later chapter he wrote the great subverter of pyrrhonism or the excessive principles of skepticism is action and employment and the occupations of common life these principles may flourish and triumph in the schools where it is indeed difficult if not impossible to refute them but as soon as they leave the shade and by the presence of the real objects which actuate our passions and sentiments are put in opposition to the more powerful principles of our nature they vanish like smoke and leave the most determined skeptic in the same condition as other mortals hume in the second part he provides an account of beliefs he explains that the difference between belief and fiction is that the former produces certain feeling of confidence which the latter doesn hume of probability this short chapter begins with the notions of probability and chance for him probability means higher chance of occurring and brings about higher degree of subjective expectation in the viewer by chance he means all those particular comprehensible events which the viewer considers possible in accord with their experience however further experience takes these equal chances and forces the imagination to observe that certain chances arise more frequently than others these gentle forces upon the imagination cause the viewer to have strong beliefs in outcomes this effect may be understood as another case of custom or habit taking past experience and using it to predict the future hume applied epistemology of the idea of necessary connection in two parts nicolas malebranche one of hume philosophical opponents by necessary connection hume means the power or force which necessarily ties one idea to another he rejects the notion that any sensible qualities are necessarily conjoined since that would mean we could know something prior to experience unlike his predecessors berkeley and locke hume rejects the idea that volitions or impulses of the will may be inferred to necessarily connect to the actions they produce by way of some sense of the power of the will he reasons that if we knew the nature of this power then the mind body divide would seem totally unmysterious to us if we had immediate knowledge of this mysterious power then we would be able to intuitively explain why it is that we can control some parts of our bodies our hands or tongues and not others the liver or heart we have no immediate knowledge of the powers which allow an impulse of volition to create an action of the muscles and nerves and animal spirits which are the immediate cause of an action hume he produces like arguments against the notion that we have knowledge of these powers as they affect the mind alone hume he also argues in brief against the idea that causes are mere occasions of the will of some god view associated with the philosopher nicolas malebranche hume having dispensed with these alternative explanations he identifies the source of our knowledge of necessary connections as arising out of observation of constant conjunction of certain impressions across many instances in this way people know of necessity through rigorous custom or habit and not from any immediate knowledge of the powers of the will hume of liberty and necessity in two parts here hume tackles the problem of how liberty may be reconciled with metaphysical necessity otherwise known as compatibilist formulation of free will hume believes that all disputes on the subject have been merely verbal arguments that is to say arguments which are based on lack of prior agreement on definitions he first shows that it is clear that most events are deterministic but human actions are more controversial however he thinks that these too occur out of necessity since an outside observer can see the same regularity that he would in purely physical system to show the compatibility of necessity and liberty hume defines liberty as the ability to act on the basis of one will the capacity to will one actions but not to will one will he then shows quite briefly how determinism and free will are compatible notions and have no bad consequences on ethics or moral life of the reason of animals comparable to man hume insists that the conclusions of the enquiry will be very powerful if they can be shown to apply to animals and not just humans he believed that animals were able to infer the relation between cause and effect in the same way that humans do through learned expectations hume he also notes that this inferential ability that animals have is not through reason but custom alone hume concludes that there is an innate faculty of instincts which both beasts and humans share namely the ability to reason experimentally through custom nevertheless he admits humans and animals differ in mental faculties in number of ways including differences in memory and attention inferential abilities ability to make deductions in long chain ability to grasp ideas more or less clearly the human capacity to worry about conflating unrelated circumstances sagely prudence which arrests generalizations capacity for greater inner library of analogies to reason with an ability to detach oneself and scrap one own biases and an ability to converse through language and thus gain from the experience of others testimonies hume footnote of miracles in two parts the next topic which hume strives to give treatment is that of the reliability of human testimony and of the role that testimony plays part in epistemology this was not an idle concern for hume depending on its outcome the entire treatment would give the epistemologist degree of certitude in the treatment of miracles true to his empirical thesis hume tells the reader that though testimony does have some force it is never quite as powerful as the direct evidence of the senses that said he provides some reasons why we may have basis for trust in the testimony of persons because human memory can be relatively tenacious and because people are inclined to tell the truth and ashamed of telling falsities needless to say these reasons are only to be trusted to the extent that they conform to experience hume and there are number of reasons to be skeptical of human testimony also based on experience if testimonies conflict one another there are small number of witnesses the speaker has no integrity the speaker is overly hesitant or bold or the speaker is known to have motives for lying then the epistemologist has reason to be skeptical of the speaker claims hume there is one final criterion that hume thinks gives us warrant to doubt any given testimony and that is if the propositions being communicated are miraculous hume understands miracle to be any event which contradicts the laws of nature he argues that the laws of nature have an overwhelming body of evidence behind them and are so well demonstrated to everyone experience that any deviation from those laws necessarily flies in the face of all evidence hume moreover he stresses that talk of the miraculous has no surface validity for four reasons first he explains that in all of history there has never been miracle which was attested to by wide body of disinterested experts second he notes that human beings delight in sense of wonder and this provides villain with an opportunity to manipulate others third he thinks that those who hold onto the miraculous have tended towards barbarism finally since testimonies tend to conflict with one another when it comes to the miraculous that is one man religious miracle may be contradicted by another man miracle any testimony relating to the fantastic is self denunciating hume still hume takes care to warn that historians are generally to be trusted with confidence so long as their reports on facts are extensive and uniform however he seems to suggest that historians are as fallible at interpreting the facts as the rest of humanity thus if every historian were to claim that there was solar eclipse in the year then though we might at first naively regard that as in violation of natural laws we come to accept it as fact but if every historian were to assert that queen elizabeth was observed walking around happy and healthy after her funeral and then interpreted that to mean that they had risen from the dead then we have reason to appeal to natural laws in order to dispute their interpretation hume of particular providence and of future state hume continues his application of epistemology to theology by an extended discussion on heaven and hell the brunt of this chapter allegedly narrates the opinions not of hume but of one of hume anonymous friends who again presents them in an imagined speech by the philosopher epicurus his friend argues that though it is possible to trace cause from an effect it is not possible to infer unseen effects from cause thus traced the friend insists then that even though we might postulate that there is first cause behind all things god we can infer anything about the afterlife because we don know anything of the afterlife from experience and we can infer it from the existence of god hume hume offers his friend an objection if we see an unfinished building then can we infer that it has been created by humans with certain intentions and that it will be finished in the future his friend concurs but indicates that there is relevant disanalogy that we can pretend to know the contents of the mind of god while we can know the designs of other humans hume seems essentially persuaded by his friend reasoning hume of the academical or skeptical philosophy in three parts the first section of the last chapter is well organized as an outline of various skeptical arguments the treatment includes the arguments of atheism cartesian skepticism light skepticism and rationalist critiques of empiricism hume shows that even light skepticism leads to crushing doubts about the world which while they ultimately are philosophically justifiable may only be combated through the non philosophical adherence to custom or habit he ends the section with his own reservations towards cartesian and lockean epistemologies in the second section he returns to the topic of hard skepticism by sharply denouncing it for here is the chief and most confounding objection to excessive skepticism that no durable good can ever result from it while it remains in its full force and vigor we need only ask such skeptic what his meaning is and what he proposes by all these curious researches he is immediately at loss and knows not what to answer pyrrhonian cannot expect that his philosophy will have any constant influence on the mind or if it had that its influence would be beneficial to society on the contrary he must acknowledge if he will acknowledge anything that all human life must perish were his principles universally and steadily to prevail hume he concludes the volume by setting out the limits of knowledge once and for all when we run over libraries persuaded of these principles what havoc must we make if we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics for instance let us ask does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number no does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence no commit it then to the flames for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion critiques and rejoinders the criteria hume lists in his examination of the validity of human testimony are roughly upheld in modern social psychology under the rubric of the communication persuasion paradigm supporting literature includes the work of social impact theory which discusses persuasion in part through the number of persons engaging in influence as well as studies made on the relative influence of communicator credibility in different kinds of persuasion and examinations of the trustworthiness of the speaker the custom view of learning can in many ways be likened to associationist psychology this point of view has been subject to severe criticism in the research of the th century still testing on the subject has been somewhat divided testing on certain animals like cats have concluded that they do not possess any faculty which allow their minds to grasp an insight into cause and effect however it has been shown that some animals like chimpanzees were able to generate creative plans of action to achieve their goals and thus would seem to have causal insight which transcends mere custom references external links an enquiry concerning human understanding mirrored at ebooks adelaide version of this work slightly edited for easier reading an enquiry

acetylene systematic name ethyne is the chemical compound with the formula it is hydrocarbon and the simplest alkyne this colorless gas is widely used as fuel and chemical building block it is unstable in its pure form and thus is usually handled as solution pure acetylene is odorless but commercial grades usually have marked odor due to impurities as an alkyne acetylene is unsaturated because its two carbon atoms are bonded together in triple bond the carbon carbon triple bond places all four atoms in the same straight line with cch bond angles of discovery acetylene was discovered in by edmund davy who identified it as new carburet of hydrogen it was rediscovered in by french chemist marcellin berthelot who coined the name acétylène berthelot empirical formula for acetylene as well as the alternative name quadricarbure hydrogène hydrogen quadricarbide were incorrect because chemists at that time used the wrong atomic mass for carbon instead of berthelot was able to prepare this gas by passing vapours of organic compounds methanol ethanol etc through red hot tube and collecting the effluent he also found acetylene was formed by sparking electricity through mixed cyanogen and hydrogen gases berthelot later obtained acetylene directly by passing hydrogen between the poles of carbon arc commercially available acetylene gas could smell foul due to the common impurities hydrogen sulfide and phosphine however as purity increases it becomes odourless preparation since the acetylene has mainly been manufactured by the partial combustion of methane or appears as side product in the ethylene stream from cracking of hydrocarbons approximately tonnes were produced by this method in its presence in ethylene is usually undesirable because of its explosive character and its ability to poison ziegler natta catalysts it is selectively hydrogenated into ethylene usually using pd ag catalysts until the when oil supplanted coal as the chief source of reduced carbon acetylene and the aromatic fraction from coal tar was the main source of organic chemicals in the chemical industry it was prepared by the hydrolysis of calcium carbide reaction discovered by friedrich wöhler in and still familiar to students cac ca oh calcium carbide production requires extremely high temperatures necessitating the use of an electric arc furnace in the us this process was an important part of the late th century revolution in chemistry enabled by the massive hydroelectric power project at niagara falls bonding in terms of valence bond theory in each carbon atom the orbital hybridizes with one orbital thus forming an sp hybrid the other two orbitals remain unhybridized the two ends of the two sp hybrid orbital overlap to form strong valence bond between the carbons while on each of the other two ends hydrogen atoms attach also by bonds the two unchanged orbitals form pair of weaker bonds since acetylene is linear symmetrical molecule it possesses the point group physical properties changes of state at atmospheric pressure acetylene cannot exist as liquid and does not have melting point the triple point on the phase diagram corresponds to the melting point at the minimum pressure at which liquid acetylene can exist atm at temperatures below the triple point solid acetylene can change directly to the vapour gas by sublimation the sublimation point at atmospheric pressure is other the adiabatic flame temperature in air at atmospheric pressure is acetylene gas can be dissolved in acetone or in room temperature and atm reactions metal acetylides since acetylene has pka of acetylene can be deprotonated by superbase to form an acetylide hc ch rm rh hc cm various organometallic and inorganic reagents are effective the formation of the acetylide depends upon several factors such as the pkb of the base the valency of the metal and solvent characteristics copper acetylide and silver acetylide can be formed in aqueous solutions with especial ease due to poor solubility equilibrium reppe chemistry walter reppe discovered that in the presence of metal catalysts acetylene can react to give wide range of industrially significant chemicals with alcohols hydrogen cyanide hydrogen chloride or carboxylic acids to give vinyl compounds px with carbonyl groups to give ethynyl alcohols in ethynylation reactions px butynediol is produced industrially in this way from formaldehyde and acetylene with carbon monoxide to give acrylic acid or acrylic esters which can be used to produce acrylic glass px px cyclization to give benzene see alkyne trimerisation or hydroquinone px px fe co oh feco at basic conditions applications welding approximately of acetylene is supplied by the industrial gases industry for oxyacetylene gas welding and cutting due to the high temperature of the flame combustion of acetylene with oxygen produces flame of over releasing kj oxyacetylene is the hottest burning common fuel gas acetylene is the third hottest natural chemical flame after and cyanogen at oxy acetylene welding was popular welding process in previous decades the development and advantages of arc based welding processes have made oxy fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly on the other hand oxy acetylene welding equipment is quite versatile not only because the torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding as in certain artistic applications but also because it lends itself easily to brazing braze welding metal heating for annealing or tempering bending or forming the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts and other applications bell canada cable repair technicians still use portable acetylene fuelled torch kits as soldering tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in manholes and in some aerial locations oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible as well oxy fuel cutting is still popular and oxy acetylene cutting is used in many metal fabrication shops for use in welding and cutting the working pressures must be controlled by regulator since above psi if subjected to shockwave caused for example by flashback acetylene decomposes explosively into hydrogen and carbon acetylene fuel container burner as used in the island of bali portable lighting calcium carbide was used to generate acetylene used in the lamps for portable or remote applications it was used for miners and cavers before the widespread use of incandescent lighting or many years later low power high lumen led lighting and is still used by mining industries in some nations without workplace safety laws it was also used as an early light source for lighthouses plastics and acrylic acid derivatives except in china use of acetylene as chemical feedstock has declined by from to owing to cost and environmental considerations acetylene can be to ethylene providing feedstock for variety of polyethylene plastics another major application of acetylene especially in china is its conversion to acrylic acid derivatives these derivatives form products such as acrylic fibers glasses paints resins and polymers niche applications in the russian chemist mikhail kucherov described the hydration of acetylene to acetaldehyde using catalysts such as mercury ii bromide before the advent of the wacker process this reaction was conducted on an industrial scale the polymerization of acetylene with ziegler natta catalysts produces polyacetylene films polyacetylene chain of ch centres with alternating single and double bonds was one of the first discovered organic semiconductors its reaction with iodine produces highly electrically conducting material although such materials are not useful these discoveries led to the developments of organic semiconductors as recognized by the nobel prize in chemistry in to alan heeger alan macdiarmid and hideki shirakawa in the early th century acetylene was widely used for illumination including street lighting in some towns most early automobiles used carbide lamps before the adoption of electric headlights acetylene is sometimes used for carburization that is hardening of steel when the object is too large to fit into furnace acetylene is used to volatilize carbon in radiocarbon dating the carbonaceous material in an archeological sample is treated with lithium metal in small specialized research furnace to form lithium carbide also known as lithium acetylide the carbide can then be reacted with water as usual to form acetylene gas to feed into mass spectrometer to measure the isotopic ratio of carbon to carbon natural occurrence the energy richness of the triple bond and the rather high solubility of acetylene in water make it suitable substrate for bacteria provided an adequate source is available number of bacteria living on acetylene have been identified the enzyme acetylene hydratase catalyzes the hydration of acetylene to give acetaldehyde ch cho acetylene is moderately common chemical in the universe often associated with the atmospheres of gas giants one curious discovery of acetylene is on enceladus moon of saturn natural acetylene is believed to form from catalytic decomposition of long chain hydrocarbons at temperatures of and above since such temperatures are highly unlikely on such small distant body this discovery is potentially suggestive of catalytic reactions within that moon making it promising site to search for prebiotic chemistry safety and handling acetylene is not especially toxic but when generated from calcium carbide it can contain toxic impurities such as traces of phosphine and arsine which give it distinct garlic like smell it is also highly flammable as most light hydrocarbons hence its use in welding its most singular hazard is associated with its intrinsic instability especially when it is pressurized under certain conditions acetylene can react in an exothermic addition type reaction to form number of products typically benzene and or vinylacetylene possibly in addition to carbon and hydrogen consequently acetylene if initiated by intense heat or shockwave can decompose explosively if the absolute pressure of the gas exceeds about most regulators and pressure gauges on equipment report gauge pressure and the safe limit for acetylene therefore is kpagage or psig it is therefore supplied and stored dissolved in acetone or dmf contained in gas cylinder with porous filling agamassan which renders it safe to transport and use given proper handling acetylene cylinders should be used in the upright position to avoid withdrawing acetone during use information on safe storage of acetylene in upright cylinders is provided by the osha compressed gas association united states mine safety and health administration msha eiga and other agencies copper catalyses the decomposition of acetylene and as result acetylene should not be transported in copper pipes brass pipe fittings should also be avoided cylinders should be stored in an area segregated from oxidizers to avoid exacerbated reaction in case of fire leakage acetylene cylinders should not be

the bac le ambush french marine infantry deploy beneath the nui dong nai cliffs in partisans during the january uprising an ambush is long established military tactic in which combatants take advantage of concealment and the element of surprise to attack unsuspecting enemy combatants from concealed positions such as among dense underbrush or behind hilltops ambushes have been used consistently throughout history from ancient to modern warfare in the th century an ambush might involve thousands of soldiers on large scale such as over choke point such as mountain pass or small irregular band or insurgent group attacking regular armed force patrol history the use by early humans of the ambush may date as far back as two million years when anthropologists have recently suggested that ambush techniques were used to hunt large game one example from ancient times is the battle of the trebia river hannibal encamped within striking distance of the romans with the trebia river between them and placed strong force of cavalry and infantry in concealment near the battle zone he had noticed says polybius place between the two camps flat indeed and treeless but well adapted for an ambuscade as it was traversed by water course with steep banks densely overgrown with brambles and other thorny plants and here he proposed to lay stratagem to surprise the enemy when the roman infantry became entangled in combat with his army the hidden ambush force attacked the legionnaires in the rear the result was slaughter and defeat for the romans nevertheless the battle also displays the effects of good tactical discipline on the part of the ambushed force although most of the legions were lost about romans cut their way through to safety maintaining unit cohesion this ability to maintain discipline and break out or maneuver away from kill zone is hallmark of good troops and training in any ambush situation see ranger reference below another famous ambush was that sprung by germanic warchief arminius against the romans at battle of the teutoburg forest this particular ambush was to affect the course of western history the germanic forces demonstrated several principles needed for successful ambush they took cover in difficult forested terrain allowing the warriors time and space to mass without detection they had the element of surprise and this was also aided by the defection of arminius from roman ranks prior to the battle they sprang the attack when the romans were most vulnerable when they had left their fortified camp and were on the march in pounding rainstorm the germans did not dawdle at the hour of decision but attacked quickly using massive series of short rapid vicious charges against the length of the whole roman line with charging units sometimes withdrawing to the forest to regroup while others took their place the germans also used blocking obstacles erecting trench and earthen wall to hinder roman movement along the route of the killing zone the result was mass slaughter of the romans and the destruction of three legions the germanic victory caused limit on roman expansion in the west ultimately it established the rhine as the boundary of the roman empire for the next four hundred years until the decline of the roman influence in the west the roman empire made no further concerted attempts to conquer germania beyond the rhine arabia during muhammad era according to muslim tradition islamic prophet muhammad used ambush tactics in his military campaigns his first such use was during the caravan raids in the kharrar caravan raid sa ibn abi waqqas was ordered to lead raid against the quraysh his group consisted of about twenty muhajirs this raid was done about month after the previous sa with his soldiers set up an ambush in the valley of kharrar on the road to mecca and waited to raid returning meccan caravan from syria but the caravan had already passed and the muslims returned to medina without any loot arab tribes during muhammad era also used ambush tactics one example retold in muslim tradition is said to have taken place during the first raid on banu thalabah the banu thalabah tribe were already aware of the impending attack so they lay in wait for the muslims and when muhammad ibn maslama arrived at the site the banu thalabah with men ambushed them while the muslims were making preparation to sleep and after brief resistance killed all of muhammad ibn maslama men muhammad ibn maslama pretended to be dead muslim who happened to pass that way found him and assisted him to return to medina the raid was unsuccessful procedure in modern warfare an ambush is most often employed by ground troops up to platoon size against enemy targets which may be other ground troops or possibly vehicles however in some situations especially when deep behind enemy lines the actual attack will be carried out by platoon company sized unit will be deployed to support the attack group setting up and maintaining forward patrol harbour from which the attacking force will deploy and to which they will retire after the attack planning us army idealised linear ambush plan us army idealised shaped ambush plan ambushes are complex multi phase operations and are therefore usually planned in some detail first suitable killing zone is identified this is the place where the ambush will be laid it is generally place where enemy units are expected to pass and which gives reasonable cover for the deployment execution and extraction phases of the ambush patrol path along wooded valley floor would be typical example ambush can be described geometrically as linear when number of firing units are equally distant from the linear kill zone shaped when short leg of firing units are placed to enfilade fire the length of the sides of the linear kill zone shaped when the firing units are distant from the kill zone at the end where the enemy enters so the firing units lay down bands of intersecting and interlocking fire this ambush is normally triggered only when the enemy is well into the kill zone the intersecting bands of fire prevent any attempt of moving out of the kill zone viet cong ambush techniques the vc nva prepared the battlefield carefully siting automatic weapons at treetop level for example helped shoot down several us helicopters during the battle of dak to ambush criteria the terrain for the ambush had to meet strict criteria provide concealment to prevent detection from the ground or air enable ambush force to deploy encircle and divide the enemy allow for heavy weapons emplacements to provide sustained fire enable the ambush force to set up observation posts for early detection of the enemy permit the secret movement of troops to the ambush position and the dispersal of troops during withdrawal one important feature of the ambush was that the target units should pile up after being attacked thus preventing them any easy means of withdrawal from the kill zone and hindering their use of heavy weapons and supporting fires terrain was usually selected which would facilitate this and slow down the enemy the terrain around the ambush site which was not favorable to the ambushing force or which offered some protection to the target was heavily mined and booby trapped or pre registered for mortars ambush units the nva vc ambush formations consisted of lead blocking element main assault element rear blocking element observation posts command post other elements might also be included if the situation demanded such as sniper screen along nearby avenue of approach to delay enemy reinforcement command posts when deploying into an ambush site the nva first occupied several observation posts placed to detect the enemy as early as possible and to report on the formation it was using its strength and firepower as well as to provide early warning to the unit commander usually one main op and several secondary op were established runners and occasionally radios were used to communicate between the op and the main command post the op were located so that they could observe enemy movement into the ambush and often they would remain in position throughout the ambush in order to report routes of reinforcement and withdrawal by the enemy as well as his maneuver options frequently the op were reinforced to squad size and served as flank security the command post was situated in central location often on terrain which afforded it vantage point overlooking the ambush site recon methods recon elements observing potential ambush target on the move generally stayed meters away sometimes leapfrogging recon technique was used surveillance units were echeloned one behind the other as the enemy drew close to the first it fell back behind the last recon team leaving an advance group in its place this one in turn fell back as the enemy again closed the gap and the cycle rotated this method helped keep the enemy under continuous observation from variety of vantage points and allowed the recon groups to cover one another see also ambush predator viet cong and pavn battle tactics flanking maneuver flypaper

an allele əˈliːl is variant form of given gene sometimes different alleles can result in different observable phenotypic traits such as different pigmentation good example of this trait of color variation is the work gregor mendel did with the white and purple flower colors in pea plants discovering that each color was the result of pure line trait which could be used as control for future experiments however most genetic variations result in little or no observable variation the word allele is short form of allelomorph other form word coined by william bateson and edith rebecca saunders which was used in the early days of genetics to describe variant forms of gene detected as different phenotypes it derives from the greek prefix ἀλλήλ allel meaning reciprocal or each other which itself is related to the greek adjective ἄλλος allos cognate with latin alius meaning other most multicellular organisms have two sets of chromosomes that is they are diploid these chromosomes are referred to as homologous chromosomes if both alleles at gene or locus on the homologous chromosomes are the same they and the organism are homozygous with respect to that gene or locus if the alleles are different they and the organism are heterozygous with respect to that gene alleles that lead to dominant or recessive phenotypes in many cases genotypic interactions between the two alleles at locus can be described as leading to dominant or recessive according to which of the two homozygous phenotypes the heterozygote most resembles where the heterozygote is from one of the homozygotes the allele expressed is the one that leads to the dominant phenotype the degree and pattern of dominance varies among loci this type of interaction was first formally described by gregor mendel however many traits defy this simple categorization and the phenotypes are modeled by co dominance and polygenic inheritance the term wild type allele is sometimes used to describe an allele that is thought to contribute to the typical phenotypic character as seen in wild populations of organisms such as fruit flies drosophila melanogaster such wild type allele was historically regarded as leading to dominant overpowering always expressed common and normal phenotype in contrast to mutant alleles that lead to recessive rare and frequently deleterious phenotypes it was formerly thought that most individuals were homozygous for the wild type allele at most gene loci and that any alternative mutant allele was found in homozygous form in small minority of affected individuals often as genetic diseases and more frequently in heterozygous form in carriers for the mutant allele it is now appreciated that most or all gene loci are highly polymorphic with multiple alleles whose frequencies vary from population to population and that great deal of genetic variation is hidden in the form of alleles that do not produce obvious phenotypic differences multiple alleles in the abo blood group system person with type blood displays antigens and may have genotype iaia or iai person with type blood displays antigens and may have the genotype ibib or ibi person with type ab blood displays both and antigens and has the genotype iaib and person with type blood displaying neither antigen has the genotype ii population or species of organisms typically includes multiple alleles at each locus among various individuals allelic variation at locus is measurable as the number of alleles polymorphism present or the proportion of heterozygotes in the population null allele is gene variant that lacks the gene normal function because it either is not expressed or the expressed protein is inactive for example at the gene locus for the abo blood type carbohydrate antigens in humans classical genetics recognizes three alleles ia ib and that determine compatibility of blood transfusions any individual has one of six possible genotypes iaia iai ibib ibi iaib and ii that produce one of four possible phenotypes type produced by iaia homozygous and iai heterozygous genotypes type produced by ibib homozygous and ibi heterozygous genotypes type ab produced by iaib heterozygous genotype and type produced by ii homozygous genotype it is now known that each of the and alleles is actually class of multiple alleles with different dna sequences that produce proteins with identical properties more than alleles are known at the abo locus hence an individual with type blood may be an ao heterozygote an aa homozygote or an aa heterozygote with two different alleles genotype frequencies the frequency of alleles in diploid population can be used to predict the frequencies of the corresponding genotypes see hardy weinberg principle for simple model with two alleles where is the frequency of one allele and is the frequency of the alternative allele which necessarily sum to unity then is the fraction of the population homozygous for the first allele pq is the fraction of heterozygotes and is the fraction homozygous for the alternative allele if the first allele is dominant to the second then the fraction of the population that will show the dominant phenotype is pq and the fraction with the recessive phenotype is with three alleles and in the case of multiple alleles at diploid locus the number of possible genotypes with number of alleles is given by the expression allelic dominance in genetic disorders number of genetic disorders are caused when an individual inherits two recessive alleles for single gene trait recessive genetic disorders include albinism cystic fibrosis galactosemia phenylketonuria pku and tay sachs disease other disorders are also due to recessive alleles but because the gene locus is located on the chromosome so that males have only one copy that is they are hemizygous they are more frequent in males than in females examples include red green color blindness and fragile syndrome other disorders such as huntington disease occur when an individual inherits only one dominant allele epialleles while heritable traits are typically studied in terms of genetic alleles epigenetic marks such as dna methylation can be inherited at specific genomic regions in certain species process termed epigenetic inheritance the term epiallele is used to distinguish these heritable marks from traditional alleles which are defined by nucleotide sequence specific class of epiallele the metastable epialleles has been discovered in mice and in humans which is characterized by stochastic probabilistic

an autosome is chromosome that is not an allosome sex chromosome the members of an autosome pair in diploid cell have the same morphology unlike those in allosome pairs which may have different structure the dna in autosomes is collectively known as atdna or audna for example humans have diploid genome that usually contains pairs of autosomes and one allosome pair chromosomes total the autosome pairs are labeled with numbers in humans roughly in order of their sizes in base pairs while allosomes are labelled with their letters by contrast the allosome pair consists of two chromosomes in females or one and one chromosome in males unusual combinations of xyy xxy xxx xxxx xxxxx or xxyy among other allosome combinations are known to occur and usually cause developmental abnormalities autosomes still contain sexual determination genes even though they are not sex chromosomes for example the sry gene on the chromosome encodes the transcription factor tdf and is vital for male sex determination during development tdf functions by activating the sox gene on chromosome so mutations of the sox gene can cause humans with chromosome to develop as females all human autosomes have been identified and mapped by extracting the chromosomes from cell arrested in metaphase or prometaphase and then staining them with some sort of dye most commonly giemsa these chromosomes are typically viewed as karyograms for easy comparison clinical geneticists can compare the karyogram of an individual to reference karyogram to discover the cytogenetic basis of certain phenotypes for example the karyogram of someone with patau syndrome would show that they possess three copies of chromosome karyograms and staining techniques can only detect large scale disruptions to chromosomes chromosomal aberrations smaller than few million base pairs generally cannot be seen on karyogram karyotype of human chromosomes female xx male xy center center there are two copies of each autosome chromosomes in both females and males the sex chromosomes are different there are two copies of the chromosome in females but males have single chromosome and chromosome autosomal genetic disorders an illustration of the inheritance pattern and phenotypic effects of an autosomal recessive gene autosomal genetic disorders can arise due to number of causes some of the most common being nondisjunction in parental germ cells or mendelian inheritance of deleterious alleles from parents autosomal genetic disorders which exhibit mendelian inheritance can be inherited either in an autosomal dominant or recessive fashion these disorders manifest in and are passed on by either sex with equal frequency autosomal dominant disorders are often present in both parent and child as the child needs to inherit only one copy of the deleterious allele to manifest the disease autosomal recessive diseases however require two copies of the deleterious allele for the disease to manifest because it is possible to possess one copy of deleterious allele without presenting disease phenotype two phenotypically normal parents can have child with the disease if both parents are carriers also known as heterozygotes for the condition autosomal aneuploidy can also result in disease conditions aneuploidy of autosomes is not well tolerated and usually results in miscarriage of the developing fetus fetuses with aneuploidy of gene rich chromosomes such as chromosome never survive to term and fetuses with aneuploidy of gene poor chromosomes such as chromosome are still miscarried over of the time possessing single copy of an autosome known as monosomy is nearly always incompatible with life though very rarely some monosomies can survive past birth having three copies of an autosome known as trisomy is far more compatible with life however common example is down syndrome which is caused by possessing three copies of chromosome instead of the usual two partial aneuploidy can also occur as result of unbalanced translocations during meiosis deletions of part of chromosome cause partial monosomies while duplications can cause partial trisomies if the duplication or deletion is large enough it can be discovered by analyzing karyogram of the individual autosomal translocations can be responsible for number of diseases ranging from cancer to schizophrenia unlike single gene disorders diseases caused by aneuploidy are the result of improper gene dosage not nonfunctional gene product see also aneuploidy abnormal number of chromosomes autosomal dominant autosomal recessive homologous chromosome pseudoautosomal region xy sex determination system references

al qaeda or translation the base the foundation or the fundament and alternatively spelled al qaida al qæda and sometimes al qa ida is militant sunni islamist multi national organization founded in by osama bin laden abdullah azzam and several other arab volunteers who fought against the soviet invasion of afghanistan in the al qaeda operates as network made up of islamic extremist salafist jihadists it has been designated as terrorist group by the united nations security council the north atlantic treaty organization nato the european union the united states russia india and various other countries see below al qaeda has mounted attacks on civilian and military targets in various countries including the embassy bombings the september attacks and the bali bombings the government responded to the september attacks by launching the war on terror with the loss of key leaders culminating in the death of osama bin laden al qaeda operations have devolved from actions that were controlled from the top down to actions by associated groups and lone wolf operators characteristic techniques employed by al qaeda include suicide attacks and the simultaneous bombing of different targets activities ascribed to it may involve members of the movement who have made pledge of loyalty to bin laden or the much more numerous al qaeda linked individuals who have undergone training in one of its camps in afghanistan pakistan iraq or sudan al qaeda ideologues envision complete break from all foreign influences in muslim countries and the creation of new caliphate ruling over the entire muslim world among the beliefs ascribed to al qaeda members is the conviction that christian jewish alliance is conspiring to destroy islam as salafist jihadists they believe that the killing of non combatants is religiously sanctioned but they ignore any aspect of religious scripture which might be interpreted as forbidding the murder of non combatants and internecine fighting al qaeda also opposes what it regards as man made laws and it wants to replace them with strict form of sharia law al qaeda has carried out many attacks on targets it considers kafir al qaeda is also responsible for instigating sectarian violence among muslims al qaeda leaders regard liberal muslims shias sufis and other sects as heretical and its members and sympathizers have attacked their mosques and gatherings examples of sectarian attacks include the yazidi community bombings the sadr city bombings the ashoura massacre and the april baghdad bombings since the death of bin laden in the group has been led by the egyptian ayman al zawahiri organization al qaeda philosophy has been described as centralization of decision and of execution it is thought that al qaeda leadership after the war on terror has become geographically isolated leading to the emergence of decentralized leadership of regionalized al qaeda groups many terrorism experts do not believe that the global jihadist movement is driven at every level by al qaeda leadership although bin laden still held considerable ideological sway over some muslim extremists before his death experts argue that al qaeda has fragmented over the years into variety of regional movements that have little connection with one another marc sageman psychiatrist and former central intelligence agency cia officer said that al qaeda is now just loose label for movement that seems to target the west there is no umbrella organisation we like to create mythical entity called al qaeda in our minds but that is not the reality we are dealing with this view mirrors the account given by osama bin laden in his october interview with tayseer allouni this matter isn about any specific person and is not about the al qa idah organization we are the children of an islamic nation with prophet muhammad as its leader our lord is one and all the true believers mu mineen are brothers so the situation isn like the west portrays it that there is an organization with specific name such as al qa idah and so on that particular name is very old it was born without any intention from us brother abu ubaida created military base to train the young men to fight against the vicious arrogant brutal terrorizing soviet empire so this place was called the base al qa idah as in training base so this name grew and became we aren separated from this nation we are the children of nation and we are an inseparable part of it and from those public which spread from the far east from the philippines to indonesia to malaysia to india to pakistan reaching mauritania and so we discuss the conscience of this nation bruce hoffman however sees al qaeda as cohesive network that is strongly led from the pakistani tribal areas al qaeda militant in sahel al qaeda has the following direct affiliates al qaeda in the islamic maghreb al qaeda in iraq aqi al qaeda in yemen al qaeda in somalia al qaeda in the lands beyond the sahel al qaeda in the arabian peninsula al qaeda in syria al qaeda in the indian subcontinent al qaeda in lebanon al qaeda in the malay archipelago al qaeda in kurdistan al qaeda in west africa al qaeda in bosnia and herzegovina al qaeda in gaza al qaeda in spain al qaeda in sinai peninsula al qaeda in mali al qaeda in caucasus and russia al qaeda indirect affiliates includes the following some of which have left the organization and joined the islamic state of iraq and the levant ansar dine abu sayyaf pledged allegiance to isil ansar al islam merged with isil on august turkistan islamic party caucasus emirate fatah al islam islamic jihad union islamic movement of uzbekistan jaish mohammed jemaah islamiyah lashkar taiba movement for oneness and jihad in west africa moroccan islamic combatant group rajah sulaiman movement leadership al zawahiri and bin laden in interview with hamid mir in kabul osama bin laden may osama bin laden was the most historically notable emir or commander and senior operations chief of al qaeda prior to his assassination on may by forces atiyah abd al rahman was alleged to be second in command prior to his death on august bin laden was advised by shura council which consists of senior al qaeda members estimated by western officials to consist of people one of them is thought to have been sayed tayib al madani after may ayman al zawahiri al qaeda deputy operations chief prior to bin laden death assumed the role of commander according to an announcement by al qaeda on june he replaced saif al adel who had served as interim commander on june pakistan intelligence officials announced that al rahman alleged successor abu yahya al libi had been killed in pakistan nasir al wuhayshi was said to have become second in command in he was the leader of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap until he was killed in airstrike in june al qaeda network was built from scratch as conspiratorial network that draws on leaders of all its regional nodes as and when necessary to serve as an integral part of its high command the military committee is responsible for training operatives acquiring weapons and planning attacks the money business committee funds the recruitment and training of operatives through the hawala banking system led efforts to eradicate the sources of terrorist financing were most successful in the year immediately following the september attacks al qaeda continues to operate through unregulated banks such as the or so hawaladars in pakistan some of which can handle deals of up to million it also provides air tickets and false passports pays al qaeda members and oversees profit driven businesses see in the commission report it was estimated that al qaeda required million per year to conduct its operations the law committee reviews sharia law and decides whether particular courses of action conform to it the islamic study fatwah committee issues religious edicts such as an edict in telling muslims to kill americans in the late there was publicly known media committee which ran the now defunct newspaper nashrat al akhbar newscast and handled public relations in al qaeda formed as sahab media production house to supply its video and audio materials command structure al qaeda is not operationally managed by ayman al zawahiri operational groups consult with the leadership in situations where attacks are in preparation the wilson centre when asked about the possibility of al qaeda connection to the july london bombings in metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair said al qaeda is not an organization al qaeda is way of working but this has the hallmark of that approach al qaeda clearly has the ability to provide training to provide expertise and think that is what has occurred here on august however the independent newspaper quoting police and mi investigations reported that the july bombers had acted independently of an al qaeda terror mastermind someplace abroad what exactly al qaeda is or was remains in dispute certainly it has been obliged to evolve and adapt in the aftermath of and the launch of the war on terror nasser al bahri who was osama bin laden bodyguard for four years in the run up to gives highly detailed description of how the group functioned at that time in his memoir he describes its formal administrative structure and vast arsenal as well as day to day life as member however author and journalist adam curtis argues that the idea of al qaeda as formal organization is primarily an american invention curtis contends the name al qaeda was first brought to the attention of the public in the trial of bin laden and the four men accused of the us embassy bombings in east africa the reality was that bin laden and ayman al zawahiri had become the focus of loose association of disillusioned islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy but there was no organization these were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin laden for funding and assistance he was not their commander there is also no evidence that bin laden used the term al qaeda to refer to the name of group until after september attacks when he realized that this was the term the americans had given it as matter of law the us department of justice needed to show that bin laden was the leader of criminal organization in order to charge him in absentia under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act also known as the rico statutes the name of the organization and details of its structure were provided in the testimony of jamal al fadl who said he was founding member of the group and former employee of bin laden questions about the reliability of al fadl testimony have been raised by number of sources because of his history of dishonesty and because he was delivering it as part of plea bargain agreement after being convicted of conspiring to attack military establishments sam schmidt one of his defense lawyers said there were selective portions of al fadl testimony that believe was false to help support the picture that he helped the americans join together think he lied in number of specific testimony about unified image of what this organization was it made al qaeda the new mafia or the new communists it made them identifiable as group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin laden field operatives pakistani journalist hamid mir interviewing al qaeda leader osama bin laden in afghanistan in the number of individuals in the group who have undergone proper military training and are capable of commanding insurgent forces is largely unknown documents captured in the raid on bin laden compound in show that the core al qaeda membership in was in it was estimated that al qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in different countries it was believed that no more than members were still active commanders according to the award winning bbc documentary the power of nightmares al qaeda was so weakly linked together that it was hard to say it existed apart from bin laden and small clique of close associates the lack of any significant numbers of convicted al qaeda members despite large number of arrests on terrorism charges was cited by the documentary as reason to doubt whether widespread entity that met the description of al qaeda existed insurgent forces according to author robert cassidy al qaeda controls two separate forces deployed alongside insurgents in iraq and pakistan the first numbering in the tens of thousands was organized trained and equipped as insurgent combat forces in the soviet afghan war it was made up primarily of foreign mujahideen from saudi arabia and yemen many went on to fight in bosnia and somalia for global jihad another group approximately strong live in western states and have received rudimentary combat training other analysts have described al qaeda rank and file as being predominantly arab in its first years of operation and now also includes other peoples it has been estimated that of al qaeda members have university education financing some financing for al qaeda in the came from the personal wealth of osama bin laden other sources of income in included the heroin trade and donations from supporters in kuwait saudi arabia and other islamic gulf states wikileaks released memo from the united states secretary of state sent in asserted that the primary source of funding of sunni terrorist groups worldwide was saudi arabia among the first pieces of evidence of saudi arabia conspicuous support for al qaeda was the so called golden chain list of early al qaeda funders seized during raid at the premises of the benevolence international foundation bif in sarajevo by bosnian police the hand written list validated by al qaeda defector jamal al fadl included the names of both donors and beneficiaries osama bin laden name appeared seven times among the beneficiaries while saudi and gulf based businessmen and politicians were listed among the donors besides osama bin laden among the most notable saudi recipients were adel batterjee founder of bif and designated as terror financier by the department of the treasury in and wael hamza julaidan terrorist designated in as one of al qaeda founder the most prominent saudi figures among the donors included saudi billionaire saleh kamel ceo of dallah al baraka accused of funding and supporting al qaeda operations sulaiman abdul aziz al rajhi funder of saar foundation shut down within the framework of operation green quest and ceo of al rajhi bank investigated several times by authorities for its role in financing terrorism and al qaeda especially and ahmad turki yamani son of former saudi chief of justice and former saudi minister of petroleum saleh kamel case in particular reinforces saudi arabia role as sponsor of al qaeda for years omar al bayoumi an associate of khalid almihdhar and nawaf alhazmi two highjackers received stipend from al baraka the financial group kamel directed kamel invested for several years in sudanese bank that held accounts under the names of senior al qaeda affiliates according to the wall street journal the jidda based al baraka bank one of the biggest subsidiaries of the financial group was also suspected of providing banking services to al qaeda operatives in general the documents seized during the bosnia raid pointed out that al qaeda widely exploited charities to channel financial and material support to its operatives across the globe this was the case for instance with the international islamic relief organization iiro and the muslim world league mwl the former had solid ties with al qaeda associates worldwide including al qaeda deputy ayman al zawahiri brother working for iiro in albania who had actively recruited on behalf of al qaeda and involved several egyptian islamic jihad members in iiro activities the latter was openly identified by al qaeda leader as one of the three charities al qaeda primarily relied upon for funding sources allegations of qatari support qatar has provided financial support to al qaeda as well on december the treasury designated abd al rahman al nuaimi qatari citizen close to the al thani family and human rights activist who founded the swiss based ngo alkarama as global terrorist for his activities in support to al qaeda the treasury has stated that nuaimi currently enjoying impunity in qatar has facilitated significant financial support to al qa ida in iraq and served as an interlocutor between al qa ida in iraq leaders and qatar based donors nuaimi was also accused of overseeing million monthly transfer to al qaeda in iraq for period of time as part of his role as mediator between iraq based al qaeda senior officers and qatari citizens he also allegedly entertained relationships with abu khalid al suri al qaeda top envoy in syria who processed transfer to al qaeda in moreover nuaimi is known to be associated with abd al wahhab muhammad abd al rahman al humayqani yemeni politician and founding member of alkarama listed as specially designated global terrorist sdgt by the treasury in the authorities claimed that humayqani exploited his role in alkarama to fundraise on behalf of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap prominent figure among aqap ranks he was also reported to have facilitated the flow of funding to aqap affiliates based in yemen nuaimi was accused of investing funds in the charity directed by humayqani to ultimately fund aqap about ten months after being sanctioned by the treasury nuaimi was also restrained from doing business in the uk another qatari citizen kalifa mohammed turki subayi was sanctioned by the treasury on june for his activities as gulf based al qaeda financier subayi name was added to the un security council sanctions list in upon charges of providing financial and material support to al qaeda senior leadership subayi allegedly moved al qaeda recruits to south asia based training camps he also supported financially khalid sheikh mohammed pakistani national and senior al qaeda officer who is believed to be the mastermind behind the september attack according to the commission report besides the activities of key facilitators qatar financial support to al qaeda has been channeled through qatar largest ngo the qatar charitable society currently known as qatar charity al qaeda defector al fadl who was also former member of qatar charity testified in court that abdullah mohammed yusef who served as qatar charity director was affiliated to al qaeda and simultaneously to the national islamic front political group that gave al qaeda leader osama bin laden harbor in sudan in the early legal proceedings from the trial united states vs enaam arnaout also mentioned that qatar charity was cited by bin laden in as one of the charities used to channel financial support to al qaeda operatives overseas the same documents also report bin laden complaint that the failed assassination attempt of egyptian president hosni mubarak had compromised the ability of al qaeda to exploit charities to support its operatives to the extent it was capable of it before qatar charity track record of terror financing includes support to members of al qaeda in chechnya an accusation publicly denied by hamad bin nasser al thani in qatar charity supposedly funneled money to chechnya based al qaeda affiliates furthermore qatar charity is among the ngos allegedly channelling funds to ansar dine in north mali piece of information confirmed by french military intelligence reports dating back to france intervention in the country in early the group has long been suspected of having ties to al qaeda today qatar enduring financing of al qaeda enterprises mostly benefits al qaeda affiliate in syria jabhat al nusra and is channeled primarily through kidnapping for ransom the consortium against terrorist finance catf reported that the gulf country has thus funded al nusra since al awsat estimated that qatar disbursed million in support of al nusra through kidnapping for ransom in addition to this strategy qatar has also launched fundraising campaigns on behalf of al nusra the washington post reporter joby warrick wrote in december that al nusra acknowledged qatar sponsored campaign madid sic ahl al sham as one of the preferred conduits for donations intended for the group strategy on march al quds al arabi published extracts from saif al adel document al qaeda strategy to the year abdel bari atwan summarizes this strategy as comprising five stages to rid the ummah from all forms of oppression provoke the united states and the west into invading muslim country by staging massive attack or string of attacks on us soil that results in massive civilian casualties incite local resistance to occupying forces expand the conflict to neighboring countries and engage the us and its allies in long war of attrition convert al qaeda into an ideology and set of operating principles that can be loosely franchised in other countries without requiring direct command and control and via these franchises incite attacks against the us and countries allied with the us until they withdraw from the conflict as happened with the madrid train bombings but which did not have the same effect with the july london bombings the us economy will finally collapse by the year under the strain of multiple engagements in numerous places making the worldwide economic system which is dependent on the us also collapse leading to global political instability which in turn leads to global jihad led by al qaeda and wahhabi caliphate will then be installed across the world following the collapse of the us and the rest of the western world countries atwan also noted regarding the collapse of the us if this sounds far fetched it is sobering to consider that this virtually describes the downfall of the soviet union according to fouad hussein jordanian journalist and author who has spent time in prison with al zarqawi al qaeda strategy plan consists of seven phases and is similar to the plan described in al qaeda strategy to the year the awakening this phase was supposed to last from to the goal of the phase is to provoke the united states to attack muslim country by executing an attack on us soil that kills many civilians opening eyes this phase was supposed to last from to the goal of this phase was to recruit young men to the cause and to transform the al qaeda group into movement iraq was supposed to become the center of all operations with financial and military support for bases in other states arising and standing up was supposed to last from to in this phase al qaeda wanted to execute additional attacks and focus their attention on syria hussein believed that other countries in the arabian peninsula were also in danger al qaeda expected steady growth among their ranks and territories due to the declining power of the regimes in the arabian peninsula the main focus of attack in this phase was supposed to be on oil suppliers and cyberterrorism targeting the us economy and military infrastructure the declaration of an islamic caliphate which was projected between and in this phase al qaeda expected the resistance from israel to be heavily reduced the declaration of an islamic army and fight between believers and non believers also called total confrontation definitive victory projected to be completed by the world will be beaten down by the islamic army according to the seven phase strategy the war isn projected to last longer than two years according to charles lister of the middle east institute and katherine zimmerman of the american enterprise institute the new model of al qaeda is to socialise communities and build broad territorial base of operations with the support of local communities also gaining income independent of the funding of sheiks name the english name of the organization is simplified transliteration of the arabic noun which means the foundation or the base the initial al is the arabic definite article the hence the base in arabic al qaeda has four syllables however since two of the arabic consonants in the name the voiceless uvular plosive and the voiced pharyngeal fricative are not phones found in the english language the common naturalized english pronunciations include and al qaeda name can also be transliterated as al qaida al qa ida or el qaida bin laden explained the origin of the term in videotaped interview with al jazeera journalist tayseer alouni in october the name al qaeda was established long time ago by mere chance the late abu ebeida el banashiri established the training camps for our mujahedeen against russia terrorism we used to call the training camp al qaeda the name stayed it has been argued that two documents seized from the sarajevo office of the benevolence international foundation prove that the name was not simply adopted by the mujahid movement and that group called al qaeda was established in august both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish new military group and contain the term al qaeda former british foreign secretary robin cook wrote that the word al qaeda should be translated as the database and originally referred to the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen militants who were recruited and trained with cia help to defeat the russians in april the group assumed the name qa idat al jihad which means the base of jihad according to diaa rashwan this was apparently as result of the merger of the overseas branch of egypt al jihad egyptian islamist jihad or eij group led by ayman al zawahiri with the groups bin laden brought under his control after his return to afghanistan in the mid ideology the radical islamist movement in general and al qaeda in particular developed during the islamic revival and the rise of the islamist movement during the last three decades of the th century along with less extreme movements some have argued that without the writings of islamic author and thinker sayyid qutb al qaeda would not have existed in the qutb preached that because of the lack of sharia law the muslim world was no longer muslim having reverted to pre islamic ignorance known as jahiliyyah to restore islam he said that vanguard movement of righteous muslims was needed in order to establish true islamic states implement sharia and rid the muslim world of any non muslim influences such as concepts like socialism and nationalism in qutb view the enemies of islam included treacherous orientalists and world jewry who plotted conspiracies and wickedly opposed islam in the words of mohammed jamal khalifa close college friend of bin laden islam is different from any other religion it way of life we khalifa and bin laden were trying to understand what islam has to say about how we eat who we marry how we talk we read sayyid qutb he was the one who most affected our generation qutb had an even greater influence on bin laden mentor and another leading member of al qaeda ayman al zawahiri zawahiri uncle and maternal family patriarch mafouz azzam was qutb student then protégé then personal lawyer and finally executor of his estate one of the last people to see qutb before his execution young ayman al zawahiri heard again and again from his beloved uncle mahfouz about the purity of qutb character and the torment he had endured in prison zawahiri paid homage to qutb in his work knights under the prophet banner one of the most powerful of qutb ideas was his belief that many who said they were muslims were really not rather they were apostates that not only gave jihadists legal loophole around the prohibition of killing another muslim but made it religious obligation to execute these self professed muslims these alleged apostates included leaders of muslim countries since they failed to enforce sharia law the afghan jihad against the pro soviet government december to february developed the salafist jihadist movement of which al qaeda was the most prominent example religious compatibility abdel bari atwan writes that history the guardian has described five distinct phases in the development of al qaeda beginnings in the late wilderness period in its heyday in network period from to and period of fragmentation from to today jihad in afghanistan cia funded and isi trained afghan mujahideen fighters crossing the durand line border to fight soviet forces and the soviet backed afghan government in the origins of al qaeda as network inspiring terrorism around the world and training operatives can be traced to the soviet war in afghanistan december february the us viewed the conflict in afghanistan with the afghan marxists and allied soviet troops on one side and the native afghan mujahideen some of whom were radical islamic militants on the other as blatant case of soviet expansionism and aggression cia program called operation cyclone channeled funds through pakistan inter services intelligence agency to the afghan mujahideen who were fighting the soviet occupation us government financial support for the afghan islamic militants was substantial aid to gulbuddin hekmatyar an afghan mujahideen leader and founder and leader of the hezb islami radical islamic militant faction alone amounted by the most conservative estimates to million in addition to receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in american aid hekmatyar was the recipient of the lion share of saudi aid later in the early after the us had withdrawn support hekmatyar worked closely with bin laden at the same time growing number of arab mujahideen joined the jihad against the afghan marxist regime facilitated by international muslim organizations particularly the maktab al khidamat mak which was funded by the saudi arabia government as well as by individual muslims particularly saudi businessmen who were approached by bin laden together these sources donated some million year to jihad in mak or the services office was established in peshawar pakistan by bin laden and abdullah yusuf azzam palestinian islamic scholar and member of the muslim brotherhood mak organized guest houses in peshawar near the afghan border and gathered supplies for the construction of paramilitary training camps to prepare foreign recruits for the afghan war front bin laden became major financier of the mujahideen spending his own money and using his connections with the saudi royal family and the petro billionaires of the gulf to influence public opinion about the war and raise additional funds omar abdel rahman from mak began to set up network of recruiting offices in the us the hub of which was the al kifah refugee center at the farouq mosque on brooklyn atlantic avenue among notable figures at the brooklyn center were double agent ali mohamed whom fbi special agent jack cloonan called bin laden first trainer and blind sheikh omar abdel rahman leading recruiter of mujahideen for afghanistan al qaeda evolved from mak azzam and bin laden began to establish camps in afghanistan in mak and foreign mujahideen volunteers or afghan arabs did not play major role in the war while over afghan mujahideen fought the soviets and the communist afghan government it is estimated that were never more than foreign mujahideen in the field at any one time nonetheless foreign mujahideen volunteers came from countries and the total number that participated in the afghan movement between and is reported to have been bin laden played central role in organizing training camps for the foreign muslim volunteers the soviet union finally withdrew from afghanistan in to the surprise of many mohammad najibullah communist afghan government hung on for three more years before being overrun by elements of the mujahideen with mujahideen leaders unable to agree on structure for governance chaos ensued with constantly reorganizing alliances fighting for control of ill defined territories leaving the country devastated expanding operations toward the end of the soviet military mission in afghanistan some foreign mujahideen wanted to expand their operations to include islamist struggles in other parts of the world such as palestine and kashmir number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed to further those aspirations one of these was the organization that would eventually be called al qaeda wright research suggests that al qaeda was formed at an august meeting between several senior leaders of egyptian islamic jihad abdullah azzam and bin laden where it was agreed to join bin laden money with the expertise of the islamic jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the soviets withdrew from afghanistan notes of meeting of bin laden and others on august indicate al qaeda was formal group by that time basically an organized islamic faction its goal is to lift the word of god to make his religion victorious list of requirements for membership itemized the following listening ability good manners obedience and making pledge bayat to follow one superiors in his memoir bin laden former bodyguard nasser al bahri gives the only publicly available description of the ritual of giving bayat when he swore his allegiance to the al qaeda chief according to wright the group real name wasn used in public pronouncements because its existence was still closely held secret after azzam was assassinated in the mak split with significant number joining bin laden organization in november ali mohamed former special forces sergeant stationed at fort bragg north carolina left military service and moved to california he traveled to afghanistan and pakistan and became deeply involved with bin laden plans in ali mohammed is said to have helped orchestrate bin laden relocation to sudan gulf war and the start of us enmity following the soviet union withdrawal from afghanistan in february bin laden returned to saudi arabia the iraqi invasion of kuwait in august had put the kingdom and its ruling house of saud at risk the world most valuable oil fields were within easy striking distance of iraqi forces in kuwait and saddam call to pan arab islamism could potentially rally internal dissent in the face of seemingly massive iraqi military presence saudi arabia own forces were well armed but far outnumbered bin laden offered the services of his mujahideen to king fahd to protect saudi arabia from the iraqi army the saudi monarch refused bin laden offer opting instead to allow us and allied forces to deploy troops into saudi territory the deployment angered bin laden as he believed the presence of foreign troops in the land of the two mosques mecca and medina profaned sacred soil after speaking publicly against the saudi government for harboring american troops he was banished and forced to live in exile in sudan sudan from around to al qaeda and bin laden based themselves in sudan at the invitation of islamist theoretician hassan al turabi the move followed an islamist coup état in sudan led by colonel omar al bashir who professed commitment to reordering muslim political values during this time bin laden assisted the sudanese government bought or set up various business enterprises and established camps where insurgents trained key turning point for bin laden further pitting him against the sauds occurred in when saudi arabia gave support for the oslo accords which set path for peace between israel and palestinians zawahiri and the eij who served as the core of al qaeda but also engaged in separate operations against the egyptian government had bad luck in sudan in young schoolgirl was killed in an unsuccessful eij attempt on the life of the egyptian prime minister atef sedki egyptian public opinion turned against islamist bombings and the police arrested of al jihad members and executed due to bin laden continuous verbal assault on king fahd of saudi arabia on march fahd sent an emissary to sudan demanding bin laden passport bin laden saudi citizenship was also revoked his family was persuaded to cut off his stipend million year and his saudi assets were frozen his family publicly disowned him there is controversy over whether and to what extent he continued to garner support from members of his family and or the saudi government in june an even more ill fated attempt to assassinate egyptian president mubarak led to the expulsion of eij and in may of bin laden by the sudanese government according to pakistani american businessman mansoor ijaz the sudanese government offered the clinton administration numerous opportunities to arrest bin laden ijaz claims appeared in numerous op ed pieces including one in the los angeles times and one in the washington post co written with former ambassador to sudan timothy carney similar allegations have been made by vanity fair contributing editor david rose and richard miniter author of losing bin laden in november interview with world several sources dispute ijaz claim including the national commission on terrorist attacks on the us the commission which concluded in part sudan minister of defense fatih erwa has claimed that sudan offered to hand bin ladin over to the us the commission has found no credible evidence that this was so ambassador carney had instructions only to push the sudanese to expel bin ladin ambassador carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the sudanese since at the time there was no indictment out standing refuge in afghanistan after the fall of the afghan communist regime in afghanistan was effectively ungoverned for four years and plagued by constant infighting between various mujahideen groups the origins of the taliban literally students lay in the children of afghanistan many of them orphaned by the war and many of whom had been educated in the rapidly expanding network of islamic schools madrassas either in kandahar or in the refugee camps on the afghan pakistani border according to ahmed rashid five leaders of the taliban were graduates of darul uloom haqqania madrassa in the small town of akora khattak the town is situated near peshawar in pakistan but largely attended by afghan refugees this institution reflected salafi beliefs in its teachings and much of its funding came from private donations from wealthy arabs bin laden contacts were still laundering most of these donations using unscrupulous islamic banks to transfer the money to an array of charities which serve as front groups for al qaeda or transporting cash filled suitcases straight into pakistan another four of the taliban leaders attended similarly funded and influenced madrassa in kandahar many of the mujahideen who later joined the taliban fought alongside afghan warlord mohammad nabi mohammadi harkat inqilabi group at the time of the russian invasion this group also enjoyed the loyalty of most afghan arab fighters the continuing internecine strife between various factions and accompanying lawlessness following the soviet withdrawal enabled the growing and well disciplined taliban to expand their control over territory in afghanistan and it came to establish an enclave which it called the islamic emirate of afghanistan in it captured the regional center of kandahar and after making rapid territorial gains thereafter conquered the capital city kabul in september after the sudanese made it clear in may that bin laden would never be welcome to return taliban controlled afghanistan with previously established connections between the groups administered with shared militancy and largely isolated from american political influence and military power provided perfect location for al qaeda to relocate its headquarters al qaeda enjoyed the taliban protection and measure of legitimacy as part of their ministry of defense although only pakistan saudi arabia and the united arab emirates recognized the taliban as the legitimate government of afghanistan while in afghanistan the taliban government tasked al qaeda with the training of brigade an elite part of the taliban army from the brigade was made up of mostly foreign fighters many veterans from the soviet invasion and all under the same basic ideology of the mujahideen in november as operation enduring freedom had toppled the taliban government many brigade fighters were captured or killed and those that survived were thought to head into pakistan along with bin laden by the end of some sources reported that the taliban had severed any remaining ties with al qaeda while others cast doubt on this according to senior us military intelligence officials there were fewer than members of al qaeda remaining in afghanistan in call for global salafi jihadism around the salafi groups waging salafi jihadism in bosnia entered into seemingly irreversible decline as they grew less and less aggressive groups such as eij began to drift away from the salafi cause in europe al qaeda stepped in and assumed control of around of the terrorist cells in bosnia in late at the same time al qaeda ideologues instructed the network recruiters to look for jihadi international muslims who believed that extremist jihad must be fought on global level the concept of global salafi jihad had been around since at least the early several groups had formed for the explicit purpose of driving non muslims out of every muslim land at the same time and with maximum carnage this was however fundamentally defensive strategy al qaeda sought to open the offensive phase of the global salafi jihad bosnian islamists in called for solidarity with islamic causes around the world supporting the insurgents in kashmir and iraq as well as the groups fighting for palestinian state fatwas in al qaeda announced its jihad to expel foreign troops and interests from what they considered islamic lands bin laden issued fatwa binding religious edict which amounted to public declaration of war against the us and its allies and began to refocus al qaeda resources on large scale propagandist strikes on february bin laden and ayman al zawahiri leader of egyptian islamic jihad along with three other islamist leaders co signed and issued fatwa calling on muslims to kill americans and their allies where they can when they can under the banner of the world islamic front for combat against the jews and crusaders they declared the ruling to kill the americans and their allies civilians and military is an individual duty for every muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it in order to liberate the al aqsa mosque in jerusalem and the holy mosque in mecca from their grip and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of islam defeated and unable to threaten any muslim this is in accordance with the words of almighty allah and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together and fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression and there prevail justice and faith in allah neither bin laden nor al zawahiri possessed the traditional islamic scholarly qualifications to issue fatwa however they rejected the authority of the contemporary ulema which they saw as the paid servants of jahiliyya rulers and took it upon themselves iraq al qaeda is sunni and often attacked the iraqi shia majority in an attempt to incite sectarian violence and greater chaos in the country al zarqawi purportedly declared an all out war on shiites while claiming responsibility for shiite mosque bombings the same month statement claiming to be by aqi rejected as fake letter allegedly written by al zawahiri in which he appears to question the insurgents tactic of attacking shiites in iraq in december video al zawahiri defended the islamic state in iraq but distanced himself from the attacks against civilians committed by hypocrites and traitors existing among the ranks us and iraqi officials accused aqi of trying to slide iraq into full scale civil war between iraq majority shiites and minority sunni arabs with an orchestrated campaign of civilian massacres and number of provocative attacks against high profile religious targets with attacks such as the imam ali mosque bombing the day of ashura and karbala and najaf bombings the first al askari mosque bombing in samarra the deadly single day series of bombings in which at least people were killed in baghdad shiite district of sadr city and the second al askari bombing in they provoked shiite militias to unleash wave of retaliatory attacks resulting in death squad style killings and spiraling further sectarian violence which escalated in and brought iraq to the brink of violent anarchy in in sectarian bombings blamed on al qaeda in iraq killed at least people at the imam husayn shrine in karbala in march and at least people at bus stop in baghdad in june in february after prolonged dispute with al qaeda in iraq successor organisation the islamic state of iraq and the levant isis al qaeda publicly announced it was cutting all ties with the group reportedly for its brutality and notorious

export young people to participate in military actions against americans at the afpak border the percentage of terrorist attacks in the west originating from the afghanistan pakistan afpak border declined considerably from almost to in and to in as al qaeda shifted to somalia and yemen while al qaeda leaders are hiding in the tribal areas along the afpak border the middle tier of the movement display heightened activity in somalia and yemen we know that south asia is no longer their primary base us defense agency source said they are looking for hide out in other parts of the world and continue to expand their organization in january al qaeda division in saudi arabia merged with its yemeni wing to form al qaeda in the arabian peninsula centered in yemen the group takes advantage of the country poor economy demography and domestic security in august they made the first assassination attempt against member of the saudi royal dynasty in decades president obama asked his yemen counterpart ali abdullah saleh to ensure closer cooperation with the us in the struggle against the growing activity of al qaeda in yemen and promised to send additional aid because of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the us was unable to pay sufficient attention to somalia and yemen which could cause problems in the near future in december us secretary of defense leon panetta said that the us operations against al qaeda are now concentrating on key groups in yemen somalia and north africa al qaeda in the arabian peninsula claimed responsibility for the bombing attack on northwest airlines flight by umar farouk abdulmutallab the group released photos of abdulmutallab smiling in white shirt and white islamic skullcap with the al qaeda in arabian peninsula banner in the background the

deliberately crashing two into the twin towers of the world trade center in new york city and the third into the western side of the pentagon in arlington county virginia the fourth however failed to reach its intended target either the united states capitol or the white house both located in washington due to the rebellion by the passengers to retake the airliner and instead crashed into the field in shanksville pennsylvania in total the attackers killed victims and injured more than others officials called anwar al awlaki an example of al qaeda reach into the in after probes into his ties to the september attacks hijackers former fbi agent identifies awlaki as known senior recruiter for al qaeda and spiritual motivator awlaki sermons in the were attended by three of the hijackers

shooting an unnamed official claimed there was good reason to believe awlaki has been involved in very serious terrorist activities since leaving the in including plotting attacks against america and our allies president barack obama approved the targeted killing of al awlaki by april making al awlaki the first us citizen ever placed on the cia target list that required the consent of the national security council and officials said it was appropriate for an individual who posed an imminent danger to national security in may faisal shahzad who pleaded guilty to the times square car bombing attempt told interrogators he was inspired by al awlaki and sources said shahzad had made contact with al awlaki over the internet representative jane harman called him terrorist number one and investor business daily called him the world most dangerous man in july the us treasury department added him to its list of specially designated global terrorists and the un added him to its list of individuals associated with al qaeda in august al awlaki father initiated lawsuit against the government with the american civil liberties union challenging its order to kill al awlaki in october and officials linked al awlaki to the cargo plane bomb plot in september he was killed in targeted killing drone attack in yemen it was reported on march that osama bin laden plotted to kill united states president barack obama death of osama bin laden view of osama bin laden compound in abbottabad pakistan where he was killed on may on may in washington may pakistan standard time president barack obama announced that osama bin laden had been killed by small team of americans acting under obama direct orders in covert operation in abbottabad pakistan about north of islamabad according to officials team of us navy seals under the command of the joint special operations command and working with the cia stormed bin laden compound in two helicopters bin laden and those with him were killed during firefight in which forces experienced no casualties according to one us official the attack was carried out without the knowledge or consent of the pakistani authorities in pakistan some people were reported to be shocked at the unauthorized incursion by us armed forces the site is few miles from the pakistan military academy in kakul in his broadcast announcement president obama said that forces took care to avoid civilian casualties details soon emerged that three men and woman were killed along with bin laden the woman being killed when she was used as shield by male combatant dna from bin laden body compared with dna samples on record from his dead sister confirmed bin laden identity the body was recovered by the us military and was in its custody until according to one us official his body was buried at sea according to islamic traditions one official stated that finding country willing to accept the remains of the world most wanted terrorist would have been difficult state department issued worldwide caution for americans following bin laden death and diplomatic facilities everywhere were placed on high alert senior official said crowds gathered outside the white house and in new york city times square to celebrate bin laden death syria military situation in the syrian civil war as of the scene of an october aleppo bombings for which al nusra front claimed responsibility in president bashar al assad revealed in an interview with kuwaiti newspaper that he doubted that al qaeda even existed he was quoted as saying is there really an entity called al qaeda was it in afghanistan does it exist now he went on further to remark about bin laden commenting he cannot talk on the phone or use the internet but he can direct communications to the four corners of the world this is illogical following the mass protests that took place later in demanding the resignation of al assad al qaeda affiliated groups and sunni sympathizers soon began to constitute the most effective fighting force in the syrian opposition until then al qaeda presence in syria was not worth mentioning but its growth thereafter was rapid groups such as the al nusra front and the islamic state of iraq and the levant isis sometimes isil have recruited many foreign mujahideen to train and fight in what has gradually become highly sectarian war ideologically the syrian civil war has served the interests of al qaeda as it pits mainly sunni opposition against shia backed government viewing shia islam as heretical al qaeda and other fundamentalist sunni militant groups have invested heavily in the civil conflict actively backing and supporting the syrian opposition despite its clashes with moderate opposition groups such as the free syrian army fsa on february al qaeda distanced itself from isis and its actions in syria but isis and the al qaeda linked al nusra front are still able to occasionally cooperate with each other when they fight against the syrian government the saudi turkish backed al nusra launched many attacks and bombings mostly against targets affiliated with or supportive of the syrian government in october russian air strikes targeted positions held by al nusra front in early leading isil ideologue described al qaeda as the jews of jihad india in september al zawahiri announced al qaeda was establishing front in india to wage jihad against its enemies to liberate its land to restore its sovereignty and to revive its caliphate he nominated india as beachhead for regional jihad taking in neighboring countries such as myanmar and bangladesh the motivation for the video was questioned in some quarters where it was seen the militant group was struggling to remain relevant in light of the emerging prominence of isis reaction amongst muslims in india to the formation of the new wing to be known as qaedat al jihad fi shibhi al qarrat al hindiya or al qaida in the indian subcontinent aqis was one of fury leaders of several indian muslim organizations rejected al zawahiri pronouncement saying they could see no good coming from it and viewed it as threat to muslim youth in the country us intelligence analyst accused the pakistan military of stage managing the terror outfit latest advance into india bruce riedel former cia analyst and national security council official for south asia also said that pakistan should be warned that it will be placed on the list of state sponsors of terrorism riedel also said that zawahiri made the tape in his hideout in pakistan no doubt and many indians suspect the isi inter services intelligence is helping to protect him he wrote attacks the pentagon us september world trade center us september istanbul turkey november november aden yemen october nairobi kenya august dar es salaam tanzania august al qaeda around the world al qaeda has carried out total of six major terrorist attacks four of them in its jihad against america in each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its privatized businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities al qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks and very rarely makes wire transfers on december al qaeda first terrorist attack took place as two bombs were detonated in aden yemen the first target was the movenpick hotel and the second was the parking lot of the goldmohur hotel the bombings were an attempt to eliminate american soldiers on their way to somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort operation restore hope internally al qaeda considered the bombing victory that frightened the americans away but in the us the attack was barely noticed no americans were killed because the soldiers were staying in different hotel altogether and they went on to somalia as scheduled however two people were killed in the bombing an australian tourist and yemeni hotel worker seven others mostly yemenis were severely injured two fatwas are said to have been appointed by the most theologically knowledgeable of al qaeda members mamdouh mahmud salim to justify the killings according to islamic law salim referred to famous fatwa appointed by ibn taymiyyah th century scholar much admired by wahhabis which sanctioned resistance by any means during the mongol invasions late nairobi embassy bombing in bin laden personally engineered plot to assassinate clinton while the president was in manila for the asia pacific economic cooperation however intelligence agents intercepted message just minutes before the motorcade was to leave and alerted the secret service agents later discovered bomb planted under bridge on august al qaeda bombed the embassies in east africa killing people including americans in retaliation barrage of cruise missiles launched by the military devastated an al qaeda base in khost afghanistan but the network capacity was unharmed in late al qaeda planned attacks to coincide with the millennium masterminded by abu zubaydah and involving abu qatada which would include the bombing christian holy sites in jordan the bombing of los angeles international airport by ahmed ressam and the bombing of the on october al qaeda militants in yemen bombed the missile destroyer uss cole in suicide attack killing servicemen and damaging the vessel while it lay offshore inspired by the success of such brazen attack al qaeda command core began to prepare for an attack on the itself september attacks aftermath of the september attacks the september attacks were the most devastating terrorist acts in american history killing victims including civilians firefighters law enforcement officers and military personnel two commercial airliners were deliberately flown into the twin towers of the world trade center third into the pentagon and fourth originally intended to target either the united states capitol or the white house crashed in field in stonycreek township near shanksville pennsylvania it was also the deadliest foreign attack on american soil since the japanese surprise attack on pearl harbor on december the attacks were conducted by al qaeda acting in accord with the fatwa issued against the and its allies by persons under the command of bin laden al zawahiri and others evidence points to suicide squads led by al qaeda military commander mohamed atta as the culprits of the attacks with bin laden ayman al zawahiri khalid sheikh mohammed and hambali as the key planners and part of the political and military command messages issued by bin laden after september praised the attacks and explained their motivation while denying any involvement bin laden legitimized the attacks by identifying grievances felt by both mainstream and islamist muslims such as the general perception that the was actively oppressing muslims bin laden asserted that america was massacring muslims in palestine chechnya kashmir and iraq and that muslims should retain the right to attack in reprisal he also claimed the attacks were not targeted at people but america icons of military and economic power despite the fact he planned to attack in the morning where most of the people in the intended targets were present and thus generating massive amount of human casualties evidence has since come to light that the original targets for the attack may have been nuclear power stations on the east coast of the the targets were later altered by al qaeda as it was feared that such an attack might get out of hand designation as terrorist group al qaeda is deemed designated terrorist group by the following countries and international organizations designated al qaeda turkish branch united nations security council war on terror us troops in afghanistan in the immediate aftermath of the attacks the us government responded militarily and began to prepare its armed forces to overthrow the taliban regime it believed was harboring al qaeda before the us attacked it offered taliban leader mullah omar chance to surrender bin laden and his top associates the first forces to be inserted into afghanistan were paramilitary officers from the cia elite special activities division sad the taliban offered to turn over bin laden to neutral country for trial if the us would provide evidence of bin laden complicity in the attacks us president george bush responded by saying we know he guilty turn him over and british prime minister tony blair warned the taliban regime surrender bin laden or surrender power soon thereafter the us and its allies invaded afghanistan and together with the afghan northern alliance removed the taliban government in the war in afghanistan as result of the us using its special forces and providing air support for the northern alliance ground forces both taliban and al qaeda training camps were destroyed and much of the operating structure of al qaeda is believed to have been disrupted after being driven from their key positions in the tora bora area of afghanistan many al qaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged gardez region of the nation khalid sheikh mohammed after his arrest in rawalpindi pakistan in march again under the cover of intense aerial bombardment us infantry and local afghan forces attacked shattering the al qaeda position and killing or capturing many of the militants by early al qaeda had been dealt serious blow to its operational capacity and the afghan invasion appeared an initial success nevertheless significant taliban insurgency remains in afghanistan and al qaeda top two leaders bin laden and al zawahiri evaded capture debate raged about the exact nature of al qaeda role in the attacks and after the us invasion began the us state department also released videotape showing bin laden speaking with small group of associates somewhere in afghanistan shortly before the taliban was removed from power although its authenticity has been questioned by couple of people the tape definitively implicates bin laden and al qaeda in the september attacks and was aired on many television channels all over the world with an accompanying english translation provided by the defense department in september the us government commission investigating the september attacks officially concluded that the attacks were conceived and implemented by al qaeda operatives in october bin laden appeared to claim responsibility for the attacks in videotape released through al jazeera saying he was inspired by israeli attacks on high rises in the invasion of lebanon as looked at those demolished towers in lebanon it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in america in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children by the end of the government proclaimed that two thirds of the most senior al qaeda figures from had been captured and interrogated by the cia abu zubaydah ramzi bin al shibh and abd al rahim al nashiri in khalid sheikh mohammed in and saif al islam el masry in mohammed atef and several others were killed the west was criticised for not being able to comprehend or deal with al qaida despite more than decade of the war this also meant no progress has been made in global state security activities africa al qaeda in the islamic maghreb formerly gspc area of operations front page of the guardian weekly on the eighth anniversary of the september attacks the article claimed that al qaeda activity is increasingly dispersed to affiliates or franchises in yemen and north africa al qaeda involvement in africa has included number of bombing attacks in north africa as well as supporting parties in civil wars in eritrea and somalia from to bin laden and other al qaeda leaders were based in sudan islamist rebels in the sahara calling themselves al qaeda in the islamic maghreb have stepped up their violence in recent years french officials say the rebels have no real links to the al qaeda leadership but this is matter of some dispute in the international press and amongst security analysts it seems likely that bin laden approved the group name in late and the rebels took on the al qaeda franchise label almost year before the violence began to escalate in mali the ansar dine faction was also reported as an ally of al qaeda in the ansar al dine faction aligned themselves with the aqim following the libyan civil war the removal of gaddafi and the ensuing period of post civil war violence in libya allowed various islamist militant groups affiliated with al qaeda to expand their operations in the region the benghazi attack which resulted in the death of us ambassador christopher stevens and other americans is suspected of having been carried out by various jihadist networks such as al qaeda in the islamic maghreb ansar al sharia and several other al qaeda affiliated groups the capture of nazih abdul hamed al ruqai senior al qaeda operative wanted by the united states for his involvement in the united states embassy bombings on october by us navy seals fbi and cia agents illustrates the importance the us and other western allies have placed on north africa europe prior to the september attacks al qaeda was present in bosnia and herzegovina and its members were mostly former veterans of the el mudžahid detachment of the bosnian muslim army of the republic of bosnia and herzegovina three members of al qaeda carried out the mostar car bombing in they were closely linked to and financed by the saudi high commission for relief of bosnia and herzegovina founded by then prince king salman of saudi arabia before the attacks and the us invasion of afghanistan recruits at al qaeda training camps who had western backgrounds were especially sought after by al qaeda military wing for conducting operations overseas language skills and knowledge of western culture were generally found among recruits from europe such was the case with mohamed atta an egyptian national studying in germany at the time of his training and other members of the hamburg cell osama bin laden and mohammed atef would later designate atta as the ringleader of the hijackers following the attacks western intelligence agencies determined that al qaeda cells operating in europe had aided the hijackers with financing and communications with the central leadership based in afghanistan in islamists carried out series of bombings in istanbul killing fifty seven people and injuring seven hundred seventy four people were charged by the turkish authorities some had previously met bin laden and though they specifically declined to pledge allegiance to al qaeda they asked for its blessing and help in three londoners tanvir hussain assad sarwar and ahmed abdullah ali were convicted of conspiring to detonate bombs disguised as soft drinks on seven airplanes bound for canada and the the massively complex police and mi investigation of the plot involved more than year of surveillance work conducted by over two hundred officers british and officials said the plot unlike many similar homegrown european islamic militant plots was directly linked to al qaeda and guided by senior al qaeda members in pakistan in russian intelligence indicated that al qaeda had given call for forest jihad and has been starting massive forest fires as part of strategy of thousand cuts arab world uss cole after the october attack following yemeni unification in wahhabi networks began moving missionaries into the country in an effort to subvert the capitalist north although it is unlikely that bin laden or saudi al qaeda were directly involved the personal connections they made would be established over the next decade and used in the uss cole bombing concerns grow over al qaeda group in yemen in iraq al qaeda forces loosely associated with the leadership were embedded in the jama at al tawhid wal jihad group commanded by abu musab al zarqawi specializing in suicide operations they have been key driver of the sunni insurgency although they played small part in the overall insurgency between and of all suicide bombings which took place in the early years were claimed by zarqawi group reports have indicated that oversights such as the failure to control access to the qa qaa munitions factory in yusufiyah have allowed large quantities of munitions to fall into the hands of al qaida in november the militant group islamic state of iraq which is linked to al qaeda in iraq threatened to exterminate all iraqi christians significantly it was not until the late that al qaeda began training palestinians this is not to suggest that resistance fighters are in the network as number of palestinians mostly coming from jordan wanted to join and have risen to serve high profile roles in afghanistan rather large groups such as hamas and palestinian islamic jihad which cooperate with al qaeda in many respects have had difficulties accepting strategic alliance fearing that al qaeda will co opt their smaller cells this may have changed recently because the israeli security and intelligence services believe that al qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the occupied territories into israel and is waiting for the right time to mount an attack saudi arabia qatar and turkey are openly supporting the army of conquest an umbrella rebel group fighting in the syrian civil war against the syrian government that reportedly includes an al qaeda linked al nusra front and another salafi coalition known as ahrar al sham kashmir bin laden and ayman al zawahiri consider india to be part of the crusader zionist hindu conspiracy against the islamic world according to the report al qaeda profile and threat assessment by congressional research service bin laden was involved in training militants for jihad in kashmir while living in sudan in the early nineties by kashmiri militant group harkat ul mujahideen had become part of the al qaeda coalition according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees al qaeda was thought to have established bases in pakistan administered kashmir in azad kashmir and to some extent in gilgit baltistan during the kargil war and continued to operate there with tacit approval of pakistan intelligence services many of the militants active in kashmir were trained in the same madrasahs as taliban and al qaeda fazlur rehman khalil of kashmiri militant group harkat ul mujahideen was signatory of al qaeda declaration of jihad against america and its allies in letter to american people written by bin laden in he stated that one of the reasons he was fighting america is because of its support to india on the kashmir issue in november kathmandu airport went on high alert after threats that bin laden planned to hijack plane from there and crash it into target in new delhi in us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld on trip to delhi suggested that al qaeda was active in kashmir though he did not have any hard evidence he proposed hi tech ground sensors along the line of control to prevent militants from infiltrating into indian administered kashmir an investigation in unearthed evidence that al qaeda and its affiliates were prospering in pakistan administered kashmir with tacit approval of pakistan national intelligence agency inter services intelligence in special team of special air service and delta force was sent into indian administered kashmir to hunt for bin laden after reports that he was being sheltered by kashmiri militant group harkat ul mujahideen which had previously been responsible for kidnapping of western tourists in kashmir britain highest ranking al qaeda operative rangzieb ahmed had previously fought in kashmir with the group harkat ul mujahideen and spent time in indian prison after being captured in kashmir us officials believe that al qaeda was helping organize campaign of terror in kashmir in order to provoke conflict between india and pakistan their strategy was to force pakistan to move its troops to the border with india thereby relieving pressure on al qaeda elements hiding in northwestern pakistan in al qaeda claimed they had established wing in kashmir this has worried the indian government however the indian army lt gen panag goc in northern command said to reporters that the army has ruled out the presence of al qaeda in indian administered jammu and kashmir furthermore he said that there is nothing that can verify reports from the media of al qaeda presence in the state he however stated that al qaeda had strong ties with kashmiri militant groups lashkar taiba and jaish mohammed based in pakistan it has been noted that waziristan has now become the new battlefield for kashmiri militants fighting nato in support of al qaeda and taliban dhiren barot who wrote the army of madinah in kashmir and was an al qaeda operative convicted for involvement in the financial buildings plot had received training in weapons and explosives at militant training camp in kashmir maulana masood azhar the founder of another kashmiri group jaish mohammed is believed to have met bin laden several times and received funding from him in jaish mohammed organized the kidnapping and murder of daniel pearl in an operation run in conjunction with al qaeda and funded by bin laden according to american counter terrorism expert bruce riedel al qaeda and taliban were closely involved in the hijacking of indian airlines flight to kandahar which led to the release of maulana masood azhar and ahmed omar saeed sheikh from an indian prison in exchange for the passengers this hijacking riedel stated was rightly described by then indian foreign minister jaswant singh as dress rehearsal for september attacks bin laden personally welcomed azhar and threw lavish party in his honor after his release according to abu jandal bodyguard of bin laden ahmed omar saeed sheikh who had been in indian prison for his role in kidnappings of

harkat ul jihad al islami who had been arrested in india in january us defense secretary robert gates while on visit to pakistan stated that al qaeda was seeking to destabilize the region and planning to provoke nuclear war between india and pakistan internet timothy thomas claims that in the wake of its evacuation from afghanistan al qaeda and its successors have migrated online to escape detection in an atmosphere of increased international vigilance as result the group use of the internet has grown more sophisticated encompassing financing recruitment networking mobilization publicity as well as information dissemination gathering and sharing abu ayyub al masri al qaeda movement in iraq regularly releases short videos glorifying the activity of jihadist suicide bombers in addition both before and after the death of abu musab al zarqawi the former leader of al qaeda in iraq the umbrella organization to which al qaeda in iraq belongs the mujahideen shura council has regular presence on the web the range of multimedia content includes guerrilla training clips stills of victims about to be murdered testimonials of suicide bombers and videos that show participation in jihad through stylized portraits of mosques and musical scores website associated with al qaeda posted video of captured american entrepreneur nick berg being decapitated in iraq other decapitation videos and pictures including those of paul johnson kim sun il and daniel pearl were first posted on jihadist websites in december an audio message claiming to be from bin laden was posted directly to website rather than sending copy to al jazeera as he had done in the past al qaeda turned to the internet for release of its videos in order to be certain it would be available unedited rather than risk the possibility of al jazeera editors editing the videos and cutting out anything critical of the saudi royal family bin laden december message was much more vehement than usual in this speech lasting over an hour in the past alneda com and jehad net were perhaps the most significant al qaeda websites alneda was initially taken down by american jon messner but the operators resisted by shifting the site to various servers and strategically shifting content the us charged british information technology specialist babar ahmad on terrorism charges related to his operating network of

aircraft turboprops and executive jets according to reuters story based on department of homeland security report the story said that al qaeda is possibly using aircraft to transport drugs and weapons from south america to various unstable countries in west africa boeing can carry up to tons of cargo the drugs eventually are smuggled to europe for distribution and sale and the weapons are used in conflicts in africa and possibly elsewhere gunmen with links to al qaeda have been increasingly kidnapping some europeans for ransom the profits from the drug and weapon sales and kidnappings can in

al qaeda and bin laden were product of monumental miscalculation by western security agencies and that al qaida literally the database was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the cia to defeat the russians munir akram permanent representative of pakistan to the united nations from to wrote in letter published in the new york times on january the strategy to support the afghans against soviet military intervention was evolved by several intelligence agencies including the and inter services intelligence or isi after the soviet withdrawal the western powers walked away from the region leaving behind militants imported from several countries to wage the anti soviet jihad pakistan was left to face the blowback of extremism drugs and guns variety of sources cnn journalist peter bergen pakistani isi brigadier mohammad yousaf and cia operatives involved in the afghan program such as vincent cannistraro deny that the cia or other american officials had contact with the foreign mujahideen or bin laden let alone armed trained coached or indoctrinated them bergen and others argue that there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamiliar with the local language customs or lay of the land since there were quarter of million local afghans willing to fight that foreign mujahideen themselves had no need for american funds since they received several hundred million dollars year from non american muslim sources that americans could not have trained mujahideen because pakistani officials would not allow more than handful of them to operate in pakistan and none in afghanistan and that the afghan arabs were almost invariably militant islamists reflexively hostile to westerners whether or not the westerners were helping the muslim afghans according to bergen known for conducting the first television interview with bin laden in the idea that the cia funded bin laden or trained bin laden is folk myth there no evidence of this bin laden had his own money he was anti american and he was operating secretly and independently the real story here is the cia didn really have clue about who this guy was until when they set up unit to really start tracking him english journalist jason burke wrote broader influence anders behring breivik the perpetrator of the norway attacks was inspired by al qaeda calling it the most successful revolutionary movement in the world while admitting different aims he sought to create european version of al qaida criticism extremism within islam goes back to the kharijites of the th century from their essentially political position they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream sunni and shiʿa muslims the kharijites were particularly noted for adopting radical approach to takfir whereby they declared other muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death according to number of sources wave of revulsion has been expressed against al qaeda and its affiliates by religious scholars former fighters and militants who are alarmed by al qaeda takfir and its killing of muslims in muslim countries especially in iraq noman benotman former afghan arab and militant member of the libyan islamic fighting group went public with an open letter of criticism to ayman al zawahiri in november after persuading the imprisoned senior leaders of his former group to enter into peace negotiations with the libyan regime while ayman al zawahiri announced the affiliation of the group with al qaeda in november the libyan

the constellation argo navis drawn by johannes hevelius argo navis the ship argo or simply argo was large constellation in the southern sky that has since been divided into the three constellations of carina puppis and vela the genitive was argus navis abbreviated arg flamsteed and other early modern astronomers called the constellation just navis the ship genitive navis abbreviated nav it was identified in greek mythology with the argo the ship used by jason and the argonauts that sailed to colchis in search of the golden fleece the original constellation is presently found near the southern horizon of the mediterranean sky becoming visible in springtime and sailed westward skimming along the southern horizon due to precession of the equinoxes many of the stars of argo have been shifted farther south since classical times and far fewer of its stars are visible today from the latitudes of the mediterranean this includes its brightest st magnitude star canopus or carinae all the stars of argo navis are easily visible south of the equator and pass near zenith from southern temperate latitudes history argo navis is the only one of the constellations listed by ptolemy in his almagest that is no longer officially recognized as constellation it was unwieldy due to its enormous size in his coelum australe stelliferum published in the french astronomer nicolas louis de lacaille explained that there were more than hundred and sixty stars clearly visible to the naked eye in navis and so he used the set of lowercase and uppercase latin letters three times on portions of the constellation referred to as argûs in carina carina the keel or hull argûs in puppi puppis the poop deck or stern and argûs in velis vela the sails lacaille replaced bayer designations with new ones that followed stellar magnitudes more closely but used only single greek letter sequence and described the constellation for those stars as argûs similarly faint non lettered stars were listed only as in argûs the final breakup and abolition of argo navis was proposed by sir john herschel in and again in but the constellation remained in use in parallel with its constituent parts into the th century in along with the other constellations it received three letter abbreviation arg the breakup and relegation to former constellation occurred in when the iau defined the modern constellations lacaille designations were kept in the three separate constellations so carina has and vela has and puppis has and so on pyxis the constellation pyxis the mariner compass occupies an area which in antiquity was considered part of argo mast some authors state that pyxis was part of the greek conception of argo navis but magnetic compasses were unknown in ancient greek times lacaille considered it separate constellation representing one of the modern scientific instruments he placed among the constellations like microscopium and telescopium pyxis was listed separately among his new constellations lacaille assigned bayer designations to pyxis separate from those of argo and his illustration shows an isolated instrument not related to the figure of the ship in john herschel suggested formalizing the mast as new constellation malus to replace lacaille pyxis but the idea did not catch on the māori had several names for what was the constellation argo including te waka tamarereti te kohi autahi and te kohi see also asterism astronomy list of stars in argo navis references external links starry night photography argo navis image star tales argo navis warburg institute iconographic database argo navis over medieval and early modern images of argo navis
antlia from ancient greek ἀντλία is constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere its name means pump in latin it represents an air pump originally antlia pneumatica the constellation was established by nicolas louis de lacaille in the th century though its name was later abbreviated by john herschel located close to the stars forming the old constellation of the ship argo navis antlia is completely visible from latitudes south of degrees north antlia is faint constellation its brightest star is alpha antliae an orange giant that is suspected variable star ranging between apparent magnitudes and antliae is an eclipsing binary star system changing in brightness as one star passes in front of the other sharing common envelope the stars are so close they will one day merge to form single star two star systems with known exoplanets hd and wasp lie within antlia as do ngc spiral galaxy and the antlia dwarf galaxy history johann bode depiction of antlia as double cylinder air pump the french astronomer nicolas louis de lacaille first described the constellation in french as la machine pneumatique the pneumatic machine in commemorating the air pump invented by the french physicist denis papin de lacaille had observed and catalogued almost southern stars during two year stay at the cape of good hope devising fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the southern celestial hemisphere not visible from europe he named all but one in honour of instruments that symbolised the age of enlightenment lacaille depicted antlia as single cylinder vacuum pump used in papin initial experiments while german astronomer johann bode chose the more advanced double cylinder version lacaille latinised the name to antlia pneumatica on his chart english astronomer john herschel proposed shrinking the name to one word in noting that lacaille himself had abbreviated his constellations thus on occasion this was universally adopted the international astronomical union adopted it as one of the modern constellations in although above the horizon and hence visible to the ancient greeks antlia stars were too faint to have been included in any ancient constellations the stars that now comprise antlia lay within an area of the sky covered by the ancient constellation argo navis the ship of the argonauts which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by lacaille in ridpath reports that due to their faintness the stars of antlia did not make up part of the classical depiction of argo navis in non western astronomy chinese astronomers were able to view what is modern antlia from their latitudes and incorporated its stars into two different constellations several stars in the southern part of antlia were portion of dong ou which represented an area in southern china furthermore epsilon eta and theta antliae were incorporated into the celestial temple which also contained stars from modern pyxis characteristics covering square degrees and hence of the sky antlia ranks nd of the modern constellations by area its position in the southern celestial hemisphere means that the whole constellation is visible to observers south of hydra the sea snake runs along the length of its northern border while pyxis the compass vela the sails and centaurus the centaur line it to the west south and east respectively the three letter abbreviation for the constellation as adopted by the international astronomical union is ant the official constellation boundaries as set by belgian astronomer eugène delporte in are defined by polygon of twelve segments illustrated in infobox at top right in the equatorial coordinate system the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and while the declination coordinates are between and features the constellation antlia as seen by the naked eye stars lacaille gave nine stars bayer designations labelling them alpha through to theta including two stars next to each other as zeta gould later added tenth iota antliae beta and gamma antliae now hr and hd ended up in the neighbouring constellation hydra once the constellation boundaries were delineated in within the constellation borders there are stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude the constellation two brightest stars alpha and epsilon antliae shine with reddish tinge alpha is an orange giant of spectral type iii that is suspected variable star ranging between apparent magnitudes and it is located light years away from earth estimated to be shining with around to times the luminosity of the sun it is most likely an ageing star that is brightening and on its way to becoming mira variable star having converted all its core fuel into carbon located light years from earth epsilon antliae is an evolved orange giant star of spectral type iiia that has swollen to have diameter about times that of the sun and luminosity of around suns it is slightly variable at the other end of antlia iota antliae is likewise an orange giant of spectral type iii located near alpha is delta antliae binary star light years distant from earth the primary is blue white main sequence star of spectral type and magnitude and the secondary is yellow white main sequence star of spectral type ve and magnitude zeta antliae is wide optical double star the brighter star zeta antliae is light years distant and has magnitude of though it is true binary star system composed of two white main sequence stars of magnitudes and that are separated by arcseconds the fainter star zeta antliae is light years distant and of magnitude eta antliae is another double composed of yellow white star of spectral type and magnitude with companion of magnitude theta antliae is likewise double most likely composed of an type main sequence star and yellow giant antliae is an eclipsing binary star system that varies in apparent magnitude from to over period of hours the system is classed as ursae majoris variable the primary is hotter than the secondary and the drop in magnitude is caused by the latter passing in front of the former calculating the properties of the component stars from the orbital period indicates that the primary star has mass times and diameter times that of the sun and the secondary has mass times and diameter times that of the sun the two stars have similar luminosity and spectral type as they have common envelope and share stellar material the system is thought to be around billion years old the two stars will eventually merge to form single fast spinning star antliae is yellow white supergiant of spectral type iab and classical cepheid variable ranging between magnitude and over days antliae is red type carbon star and is an irregular variable that ranges between magnitudes and approximately light years distant it is around times as luminous as the sun bf antliae is delta scuti variable that varies by of magnitude hr also known as ag antliae is an unusual hot variable ageing star of spectral type ib ii it is undergoing intense loss of mass and is unique variable that does not belong to any class of known variable star ranging between magnitudes and with period of days ux antliae is an coronae borealis variable with baseline apparent magnitude of around with irregular dimmings down to below magnitude luminous and remote star it is supergiant with spectrum resembling that of yellow white type star but it has almost no hydrogen composite image of ngc hd is an orange dwarf star of spectral type that is smaller and cooler than the sun it has planet that was discovered by the radial velocity method with the harps spectrograph in about as massive as saturn the planet orbits its star with period of days at mean distance of au wasp is sunlike star of spectral type planet with times the mass of jupiter orbits it every days discovered by the transit method in den is brown dwarf of spectral type located around light years distant from earth at magnitude it is much too faint to be seen with the unaided eye it has surface temperature of about two powerful flares lasting minutes each were detected in mass is system of two cool and faint brown dwarfs probably with effective temperatures of about and and masses of about and times that of jupiter though it is also possible that both objects have temperatures of and jupiter masses deep sky objects galaxy eso is located nearly million light years from earth antlia contains many faint galaxies the brightest of which is ngc at magnitude it is loosely wound face on spiral galaxy of type sc though nondescript in most amateur telescopes it presents bright clusters of young stars and many dark dust lanes in photographs discovered in the antlia dwarf is dwarf spheroidal galaxy that belongs to the local group of galaxies the antlia cluster also known as abell is cluster of galaxies located in the hydra centaurus supercluster it is the third nearest to the local group after the virgo cluster and the fornax cluster the cluster distance from earth is to located in the southeastern corner of the constellation it boasts the giant elliptical galaxies ngc

abadan ābādān is city in and the capital of abadan county khuzestan province which is located in southwest of iran it lies on abadan island long km or miles wide the island is bounded in the west by the arvand waterway and to the east by the bahmanshir outlet of the karun river the shatt al arab from the persian gulf near the iraqi iran border etymology the earliest mention of the island of abadan if not the port itself is found in works of the geographer marcian who renders the name apphadana earlier the classical geographer ptolemy notes apphana as an island off the mouth of the tigris which is where the modern island of abadan is located an etymology for this name is presented by farahvashi to be derived from the persian word ab water and the root pā guard watch thus coastguard station in the islamic times pseudo etymology was produced by the historian ahmad ibn yahya al baladhuri quoting folk story that the town was presumably founded by one abbad bin hosayn from the arabian tribe of banu tamim who established garrison there during the governorship of hajjaj in the ummayad period in the subsequent centuries the persian version of the name had begun to come into general use before it was adopted by official decree in population population year people the civilian population of the city dropped close to zero during the eight years of the iran iraq war the census recorded only people in had returned to live in the city by the population had jumped to and it was in families according to census abadan refinery is one of the largest in the world the population today has reached almost people only of managers of the oil company were from khuzestan the proportion of natives of tehran the caspian azarbaijan and kurdistan rose from of blue collar workers to of white collar workers to of managers thus arabic speakers were concentrated on the lower rungs of the work force managers tended to be brought in from some distance there is also single armenian church in the centre of the city history abadan is thought to have been further developed into major port city under the abbasids rule in this time period it was commercial source of salt and woven mats the siltation of the river delta forced the town further away from water in the th century however ibn battutah described abadan just as small port in flat salty plain politically abadan was often the subject of dispute between the nearby states in persia acquired it from turkey in which state abadan has remained since from the th century onward the island of abadan was part of the lands of the arab ka ab bani kaab tribe one section of this tribe mohaysen had its headquarters at mohammara present day khorramshahr until the removal of shaikh khaz al khan in exploded tank remains as symbol of iran iraq war ruins of building in abadan abadan had suffered serious damages during iran iraq war including saddam deadly chemical weapons it was not until the th century that rich oil fields were discovered in the area on july after secret negotiation with the british consul percy cox assisted by arnold wilson sheik khaz al agreed to rental agreement for the island including abadan the sheik continued to administer the island until the anglo persian oil company built their first pipeline terminus oil refinery in abadan starting in and completing it in with oil flowing by august see abadan refinery refinery throughput numbers rose from tons in to tons in by it was the largest in the world during world war ii abadan was the site of brief combat between iranian forces and british and indian troops during the anglo soviet invasion of iran later abadan was major logistics centre for lend lease aircraft being sent to the soviet union by the united states in iran nationalized all oil properties and refining ground to stop on the island rioting broke out in abadan after the government had decided to nationalize the oil facilities and three british workers were killed it was not until that settlement was reached which allowed consortium of international oil companies to manage the production and refining on the island this continued until when the nioc took over all facilities after total nationalization iran focused on supplying oil domestically and built pipeline from abadan to tehran whereas abadan was not major cultural or religious centre it did play an important role in the islamic revolution on august the anniversary of the us backed coup état which overthrew the nationalist and popular iranian prime minister dr mohammed mossadegh the cinema rex movie theatre in abadan iran was set ablaze the cinema rex fire caused deaths but more importantly it was another event that kept the islamic revolution moving ahead at the time there was much confusion and misinformation about the perpetrators of the incident the public largely put the blame on the local police chief and also the shah and savak the reformist sobhe emrooz newspaper in one of its editorials revealed that the cinema rex was burned down by the radical islamists the newspaper was shut down immediately after over time the true culprits radical islamists were apprehended and the logic behind this act was revealed as they were trying both to foment the general public to distrust the government even more and also as they perceived cinema as link to the americans this fire was one of four during short period in august with other fires in mashhad rizaiya and shiraz in september abadan was almost overrun during surprise attack on khuzestan by iraq marking the beginning of the iran iraq war for months abadan was besieged but never captured by iraqi forces and in september the iranians broke the siege of abadan much of the city including the oil refinery which was the world largest refinery with capacity of barrels per day was badly damaged or destroyed by the siege and by bombing previous to the war the city civilian population was about but before it was over almost the entire populace had sought refuge elsewhere in iran after the war the biggest concern was the rebuilding of abadan oil refinery as it was operating at of capacity due to damage in the refinery began limited operation and the port reopened by the refinery reached the same rate of production as before the war recently abadan has been the site of major labour activity as workers at the oil refineries in the city have staged walkouts and strikes to protest non payment of wages and the political situation in the country recent events to honour the th anniversary of the refining of oil in abadan city officials are planning an oil museum the abadan oil refinery was featured on the reverse side of iran rial banknotes printed in and from to abadan today has been declared as free zone city the healthy relationship between iran and iraq has become one of the transit cities connecting both countries through minute drive climate the climate in abadan is arid köppen climate classification bwh and similar to baghdad but slightly hotter due to abadan lower latitude summers are dry and extremely hot with temperatures above almost daily and temperatures above can be almost common abadan is notably one of the few hottest populated places on earth and experiences many sand and dust storms winters are mildly wet and spring like though subject to cold spells winter temperatures are around the world highest unconfirmed temperature was temperature flare up during heat burst in june with temperature of the lowest recorded temperature in the city range is which was recorded on january and february while the highest is recorded on july and august places of interest the abadan institute of technology was established in abadan in the school specialized in engineering and petroleum chemistry and was designed to train staff for the refinery in town the school name has since changed several times but since has been considered branch campus of the

recognized with an air operating certificate or license issued by governmental aviation body airlines vary in size from small domestic airlines to full service international airlines airline services can be categorized as being domestic regional or international and may be operated as scheduled services or charters the largest airline currently is american airlines group history the first airlines delag deutsche luftschiffahrts was the world first airline it was founded on november with government assistance and operated airships manufactured by the zeppelin corporation its headquarters were in frankfurt the first fixed wing scheduled air service was started on january from st petersburg florida to tampa florida the four oldest non dirigible airlines that still exist are netherlands klm colombia avianca australia qantas and the czech republic czech airlines european airline industry beginnings handley page was used by handley page transport an early british airline established in the earliest fixed wing airline in europe was the aircraft transport and travel formed by george holt thomas in using fleet of former military airco dh biplanes that had been modified to carry two passengers in the fuselage it operated relief flights between folkestone and ghent on july the company flew proving flight across the english channel despite lack of support from the british government flown by lt shaw in an airco dh between raf hendon and paris le bourget airport the flight took hours and minutes at per passenger on august the company used dh to pioneer regular service from hounslow heath aerodrome to le bourget the first regular international service in the world the airline soon gained reputation for reliability despite problems with bad weather and began to attract european competition in november it won the first british civil airmail contract six royal air force airco dh aircraft were lent to the company to operate the airmail service between hawkinge and cologne in they were returned to the royal air force other british competitors were quick to follow handley page transport was established in and used the company converted wartime type bombers with capacity for passengers to run london paris passenger service the first french airline was société des lignes latécoère later known as aéropostale which started its first service in late to spain the société générale des transports aériens was created in late by the farman brothers and the farman goliath plane flew scheduled services from toussus le noble to kenley near croydon england another early french airline was the compagnie des messageries aériennes established in by louis charles breguet offering mail and freight service between le bourget airport paris and lesquin airport lille junkers of junkers luftverkehr the first german airline to use heavier than air aircraft was deutsche luft reederei established in which started operating in february in its first year the operated regularly scheduled flights on routes with combined length of nearly miles by the network was more than km miles long and included destinations in the netherlands scandinavia and the baltic republics

between moscow and nizhni novgorod since all operations had been carried under the name aeroflot early european airlines tended to favor comfort the passenger cabins were often spacious with luxurious interiors over speed and efficiency the relatively basic navigational capabilities of pilots at the time also meant that delays due to the weather were commonplace rationalization the imperial airways empire terminal victoria london trains ran from here to flying boats in southampton and to croydon airport by the early small airlines were struggling to compete and there was movement towards increased rationalization and consolidation in imperial airways was formed from the merger of instone air line company british marine air navigation daimler airway and handley page transport co ltd to allow british airlines to compete with stiff competition from french and german airlines that were enjoying heavy government subsidies the airline was pioneer in surveying and opening up air routes across the world to serve far flung parts of the british empire and to enhance trade and integration the first new airliner ordered by imperial airways was the handley page city of washington delivered on november in the first year of operation the company carried passengers and letters in april the film the lost world became the first film to be screened for passengers on scheduled airliner flight when it was shown on the london paris route two french airlines also merged to form air union on january this later merged with four other french airlines to become air france the country flagship carrier to this day on october germany deutsche luft hansa was created in by merger of two airlines one of them junkers luftverkehr luft hansa due to the junkers heritage and unlike most other airlines at the time became major investor in airlines outside of europe providing capital to varig and avianca german airliners built by junkers dornier and fokker were among the most advanced in the world at the time global expansion in alan cobham surveyed flight route from the uk to cape town south africa following this up with another proving flight to melbourne australia other routes to british india and the far east were also charted and demonstrated at this time regular services to cairo and basra began in and were extended to karachi in the london australia service was inaugurated in with the handley page hp airliners further services were opened up to calcutta rangoon singapore brisbane and hong kong passengers departed london on march following the establishment of branch from penang to hong kong april map showing imperial airways routes from the uk to australia and south africa imperial aircraft were small most seating fewer than twenty passengers and catered for the rich only about passengers used imperial airways in the most passengers on routes or on services within and between british colonies were men doing colonial administration business or research like imperial airways air france and klm early growth depended heavily on the needs to service links with far flung colonial possessions north africa and indochina for the french and the east indies for the dutch france began an air mail service to morocco in that was bought out in renamed aéropostale and injected with capital to become major international carrier in aéropostale went bankrupt was nationalized and merged into air france although germany lacked colonies it also began expanding its services globally in the airship graf zeppelin began offering regular scheduled passenger service between germany and south america usually every two weeks which continued until in the airship hindenburg entered passenger service and successfully crossed the atlantic times before crashing at lakehurst new jersey on may from february until world war ii began in deutsche lufthansa operated an airmail service from stuttgart germany via spain the canary islands and west africa to natal in brazil this was the first time an airline flew across an ocean by the end of the aeroflot had become the world largest airline employing more than pilots and other service personnel and operating around aircraft of which were considered obsolete by its own standards during the soviet era aeroflot was synonymous with russian civil aviation as it was the only air carrier it became the first airline in the world to operate sustained regular jet services on september with the tupolev tu eu airline deregulation deregulation of the european union airspace in the early has had substantial effect on the structure of the industry there the shift towards budget airlines on shorter routes has been significant airlines such as easyjet and ryanair have often grown at the expense of the traditional national airlines there has also been trend for these national airlines themselves to be privatized such as has occurred for aer lingus and british airways other national airlines including italy alitalia have suffered particularly with the rapid increase of oil prices in early airline industry early development twa douglas dc in the dc often regarded as one of the most influential aircraft in the history of commercial aviation revolutionized air travel tony jannus conducted the united states first scheduled commercial airline flight on january for the st petersburg tampa airboat line the minute flight traveled between st petersburg florida and tampa florida passing some above tampa bay in jannus benoist xiv wood and muslin biplane flying boat his passenger was former mayor of st petersburg who paid for the privilege of sitting on wooden bench in the open cockpit the airboat line operated for about four months carrying more than passengers who paid each chalk international airlines began service between miami and bimini in the bahamas in february based in ft lauderdale chalk claimed to be the oldest continuously operating airline in the united states until its closure in following world war the united states found itself swamped with aviators many decided to take their war surplus aircraft on barnstorming campaigns performing aerobatic maneuvers to woo crowds in the united states postal service won the financial backing of congress to begin experimenting with air mail service initially using curtiss jenny aircraft that had been procured by the united states army air service private operators were the first to fly the mail but due to numerous accidents the us army was tasked with mail delivery during the army involvement they proved to be too unreliable and lost their air mail duties by the mid the postal service had developed its own air mail network based on backbone between new york city and san francisco to supplement this service they offered twelve contracts for spur routes to independent bidders some of the carriers that won these routes would through time and mergers evolve into pan am delta air lines braniff airways american airlines united airlines originally division of boeing trans world airlines northwest airlines and eastern air lines service during the early was sporadic most airlines at the time were focused on carrying bags of mail in however the ford motor company bought out the stout aircraft company and began construction of the all metal ford trimotor which became the first successful american airliner with passenger capacity the trimotor made passenger service potentially profitable air service was seen as supplement to rail service in the american transportation network at the same time juan trippe began crusade to create an air network that would link america to the world and he achieved this goal through his airline pan american world airways with fleet of flying boats that linked los angeles to shanghai and boston to london pan am and northwest airways which began flights to canada in the were the only airlines to go international before the with the introduction of the boeing and douglas dc in the the airline industry was generally profitable even during the great depression this trend continued until the beginning of world war ii development since in october the american export airlines became the first airline to offer regular commercial flights between north america and europe shown here is am ex boeing stratocruiser in world war ii like world war brought new life to the airline industry many airlines in the allied countries were flush from lease contracts to the military and foresaw future explosive demand for civil air transport for both passengers and cargo they were eager to invest in the newly emerging flagships of air travel such as the boeing stratocruiser lockheed constellation and douglas dc most of these new aircraft were based on american bombers such as the which had spearheaded research into new technologies such as pressurization most offered increased efficiency from both added speed and greater payload in the the de havilland comet boeing douglas dc and sud aviation caravelle became the first flagships of the jet age in the west while the eastern bloc had tupolev tu and tupolev tu in the fleets of state owned carriers such as czechoslovak čsa soviet aeroflot and east german interflug the vickers viscount and lockheed electra inaugurated turboprop transport the next big boost for the airlines would come in the when the boeing mcdonnell douglas dc and lockheed inaugurated widebody jumbo jet service which is still the standard in international travel the tupolev tu and its western counterpart concorde made supersonic travel reality concorde first flew in and operated through in airbus began producing europe most commercially successful line of airliners to date the added efficiencies for these aircraft were often not in speed but in passenger capacity payload and range airbus also features modern electronic cockpits that were common across their aircraft to enable pilots to fly multiple models with minimal cross training us airline deregulation pan am boeing clipper neptune car in the deregulation of the american airline industry increased the financial troubles of the airline which ultimately filed for bankruptcy in december the airline industry deregulation lowered federally controlled barriers for new airlines just as downturn in the nation economy occurred new start ups entered during the downturn during which time they found aircraft and funding contracted hangar and maintenance services trained new employees and recruited laid off staff from other airlines major airlines dominated their routes through aggressive pricing and additional capacity offerings often swamping new start ups in the place of high barriers to entry imposed by regulation the major airlines implemented an equally high barrier called loss leader pricing in this strategy an already established and dominant airline stomps out its competition by lowering airfares on specific routes below the cost of operating on it choking out any chance start up airline may have the industry side effect is an overall drop in revenue and service quality since deregulation in the average domestic ticket price has dropped by so has airline employee pay by incurring massive losses the airlines of the usa now rely upon scourge of cyclical chapter bankruptcy proceedings to continue doing business america west airlines which has since merged with us airways remained significant survivor from this new entrant era as dozens even hundreds have gone under in many ways the biggest winner in the deregulated environment was the air passenger although not exclusively attributable to deregulation indeed the witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers even joining frequent flyer loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying new services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city do business and return the same day from almost any point in the country air travel advantages put long distance intercity railroad travel and bus lines under pressure with most of the latter having withered away whilst the former is still protected under nationalization through the continuing existence of amtrak by the almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the and today the domestic industry operates over daily departures nationwide toward the end of the century new style of low cost airline emerged offering no frills product at lower price southwest airlines jetblue airtran airways skybus airlines and other low cost carriers began to represent serious challenge to the so called legacy airlines as did their low cost counterparts in many other countries their commercial viability represented serious competitive threat to the legacy carriers however of these ata and skybus have since ceased operations increasingly since us airlines have been reincorporated and spun off by newly created and internally led management companies and thus becoming nothing more than operating units and subsidiaries with limited financially decisive control among some of these holding companies and parent companies which are relatively well known are the ual corporation along with the amr corporation among long list of airline holding companies sometime recognized worldwide less recognized are the private equity firms which often seize managerial financial and board of directors control of distressed airline companies by temporarily investing large sums of capital in air carriers to rescheme an airlines assets into profitable organization or liquidating an air carrier of their profitable and worthwhile routes and business operations thus the last years of the airline industry have varied from reasonably profitable to devastatingly depressed as the first major market to deregulate the industry in airlines have experienced more turbulence than almost any other country or region in fact no legacy carrier survived bankruptcy free among the outspoken critics of deregulation former ceo of american airlines robert crandall has publicly stated chapter bankruptcy protection filing shows airline industry deregulation was mistake the airline industry bailout congress passed the air transportation safety and system stabilization act in response to severe liquidity crisis facing the already troubled airline industry in the aftermath of the september th terrorist attacks through the atsb congress sought to provide cash infusions to carriers for both the cost of the four day federal shutdown of the airlines and the incremental losses incurred through december as result of the terrorist attacks this resulted in the first government bailout of the st century between and us airlines lost billion with wage cuts of over billion and employees laid off in recognition of the essential national economic role of healthy aviation system congress authorized partial compensation of up to billion in cash subject to review by the department of transportation and up to billion in loan guarantees subject to review by newly created air transportation stabilization board atsb the applications to dot for reimbursements were subjected to rigorous multi year reviews not only by dot program personnel but also by the government accountability office and the dot inspector general ultimately the federal government provided billion in one time subject to income tax cash payments to air carriers with no provision for repayment essentially gift from the taxpayers passenger carriers operating scheduled service received approximately billion subject to tax in addition the atsb approved loan guarantees to six airlines totaling approximately billion data from the treasury department show that the government recouped the billion and profit of million from the fees interest and purchase of discounted airline stock associated with loan guarantees asian airline industry iran air boeing sp biman bangladesh airlines boeing er parked at shahjalal international airport dhaka biman is the flag carrier of bangladesh although philippine airlines pal was officially founded on february its license to operate as an airliner was derived from merged philippine aerial taxi company patco

of the world first major airlines which began its operations without any support from the government with the outbreak of world war ii the airline presence in asia came to relative halt with many new flag carriers donating their aircraft for military aid and other uses following the end of the war in regular commercial service was restored in india and tata airlines became public limited company on july under the name air india after the independence of india of the airline was acquired by the government of india in return the airline was granted status to operate international services from india as the designated flag carrier under the name air india international on july chartered philippine airlines pal dc ferried american servicemen to oakland california from nielson airport in makati city with stops in guam wake island johnston atoll and honolulu hawaii making pal the first asian airline to cross the pacific ocean regular service between manila and san francisco was started in december it was during this year that the airline was designated as the flag carrier of philippines during the era of decolonization newly born asian countries started to embrace air transport

second world war as did several others from other countries like mexico interjet and volaris venezuela aserca airlines and others the air travel market has evolved rapidly over recent years in latin america some industry estimates indicate that over new aircraft will begin service over the next five years in this region these airlines serve domestic flights within their countries as well as connections within latin america and also overseas flights to north america europe australia and asia only two airlines avianca and latam airlines have international subsidiaries and cover many destinations within the americas as well as major hubs in other continents latam with chile as the central operation along with peru ecuador colombia brazil and argentina and formerly with some operations in the dominican republic the aviancataca group has control of avianca brazil vip ecuador and strategic alliance with aerogal regulatory considerations national garuda indonesia boeing parked at perth international airport this indonesian flag carrier is owned by the indonesian government many countries have national airlines that the government owns and operates fully private airlines are subject to great deal of government regulation for economic political and safety concerns for instance governments often intervene to halt airline labor actions to protect the free flow of people communications and goods between different regions without compromising safety the united states australia and to lesser extent brazil mexico india the united kingdom and japan have deregulated their airlines in the past these governments dictated airfares route networks and other operational requirements for each airline since deregulation airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own operating arrangements with different airports enter and exit routes easily and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand cyprus airways the now defunct national airline of cyprus the entry barriers for new airlines are lower in deregulated market and so the has seen hundreds of airlines start up sometimes for only brief operating period this has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets the added competition together with pricing freedom means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that to limited degree full service airlines must match this is major constraint on profitability for established carriers which tend to have higher cost base as result profitability in deregulated market is uneven for most airlines these forces have caused some major airlines to go out of business in addition to most of the poorly established new entrants in the united states the airline industry is dominated by four large firms because of industry consolidation after fuel prices dropped considerably in very little of the savings were passed on to consumers international singapore airlines airbus landing at changi airport singapore airlines is the first international airline to operate the the world largest passenger airliner groups such as the international civil aviation organization establish worldwide standards for safety and other vital concerns most international air traffic is regulated by bilateral agreements between countries which designate specific carriers to operate on specific routes the model of such an agreement was the bermuda agreement between the us and uk following world war ii which designated airports to be used for transatlantic flights and gave each government the authority to nominate carriers to operate routes bilateral agreements are based on the freedoms of the air group of generalized traffic rights ranging from the freedom to overfly country to the freedom to provide domestic flights within country very rarely granted right known as cabotage most agreements permit airlines to fly from their home country to designated airports in the other country some also extend the freedom to provide continuing service to third country or to another destination in the other country while carrying passengers from overseas in the open skies agreements became more common these agreements take many of these regulatory powers from state governments and open up international routes to further competition open skies agreements have met some criticism particularly within the european union whose airlines would be at comparative disadvantage with the united states because of cabotage restrictions economic considerations juan trippe the founder of pan american world airways surveying his globe the collapse of pan am an airline often credited for shaping the international airline industry in december highlighted the financial complexities faced by major airline companies historically air travel has survived largely through state support whether in the form of equity or subsidies the airline industry as whole has made cumulative loss during its year history once the costs include subsidies for aircraft development and airport construction one argument is that positive externalities such as higher growth due to global mobility outweigh the microeconomic losses and justify continuing government intervention historically high level of government intervention in the airline industry can be seen as part of wider political consensus on strategic forms of transport such as highways and railways both of which receive public funding in most parts of the world although many countries continue to operate state owned or parastatal airlines many large airlines today are privately owned and are therefore governed by microeconomic principles to maximize shareholder profit in july the total airline capacity was billion available seat kilometers compared to july bn in asia pacific bn in europe bn in north america bn in middle east bn in latin america and bn in africa top airline groups revenue bn operating result bn operating margin net result bn net margin largest airlines the world largest airlines can be defined in several ways american airlines group is the largest by its fleet size revenue profit passengers carried and revenue passenger mile delta air lines is the largest by assets value and market capitalization lufthansa group is the largest by number of employees fedex express by freight tonne kilometers ryanair by number of international passengers carried and turkish airlines by number of countries served ticket revenue airlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability the pricing of airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely determined by computerized yield management systems because of the complications in scheduling flights and maintaining profitability airlines have many loopholes that can be used by the knowledgeable traveler many of these airfare secrets are becoming more and more known to the general public so airlines are forced to make constant adjustments most airlines use differentiated pricing form of price discrimination to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments factors influencing the price include the days remaining until departure the booked load factor the forecast of total demand by price point competitive pricing in force and variations by day of week of departure and by time of day carriers often accomplish this by dividing each cabin of the aircraft first business and economy into number of travel classes for pricing purposes complicating factor is that of origin destination control control someone purchasing ticket from melbourne to sydney as an example for is competing with someone else who wants to fly melbourne to los angeles through sydney on the same flight and who is willing to pay should the airline prefer the passenger or the passenger plus possible sydney los angeles passenger willing to pay airlines have to make hundreds of thousands of similar pricing decisions daily lufthansa boeing lufthansa is the flag carrier airline of germany the advent of advanced computerized reservations systems in the late most notably sabre allowed airlines to easily perform cost benefit analyses on different pricing structures leading to almost perfect price discrimination in some cases that is filling each seat on an aircraft at the highest price that can be charged without driving the consumer elsewhere the intense nature of airfare pricing has led to the term fare war to describe efforts by airlines to undercut other airlines on competitive routes through computers new airfares can be published quickly and efficiently to the airlines sales channels for this purpose the airlines use the airline tariff publishing company atpco who distribute latest fares for more than airlines to computer reservation systems across the world the extent of these pricing phenomena is strongest in legacy carriers in contrast low fare carriers usually offer pre announced and simplified price structure and sometimes quote prices for each leg of trip separately computers also allow airlines to predict with some accuracy how many passengers will actually fly after making reservation to fly this allows airlines to overbook their flights enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for no shows but not enough in most cases to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with overbooking on high demand flights can help reduce this figure this is especially crucial during tough economic times as airlines undertake massive cuts to ticket prices to retain demand operating costs an airbus of virgin atlantic airways in october virgin atlantic offered to combine its operations with bmi in an effort to reduce operating costs full service airlines have high level of fixed and operating costs to establish and maintain air services labor fuel airplanes engines spares and parts it services and networks airport equipment airport handling services sales distribution catering training aviation insurance and other costs thus all but small percentage of the income from ticket sales is paid out to wide variety of external providers or internal cost centers moreover the industry is structured so that airlines often act as tax collectors airline fuel is untaxed because of series of treaties existing between countries ticket prices include number of fees taxes and surcharges beyond the control of airlines airlines are also responsible for enforcing government regulations if airlines carry passengers without proper documentation on an international flight they are responsible for returning them back to the original country analysis of the period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than the airlines who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales while airlines as whole earned return on capital employed less than the cost of capital airports earned catering companies handling companies aircraft lessors aircraft manufacturers and global distribution companies more than source spinetta quoted in doganis the widespread entrance of new breed of low cost airlines beginning at the turn of the century has accelerated the demand that full service carriers control costs many of these low cost companies emulate southwest airlines in various respects and like southwest they can eke out consistent profit throughout all phases of the business cycle as result shakeout of airlines is occurring in the and elsewhere american airlines united airlines continental airlines twice us airways twice delta air lines and northwest airlines have all declared chapter bankruptcy where an airline has established an engineering base at an airport then there may be considerable economic advantages in using that same airport as preferred focus or hub for its scheduled flights operating costs for us major airlines are primarily aircraft operating expense including jet fuel aircraft maintenance depreciation and aircrew for servicing expense for traffic passenger and aircraft for reservations and sales and for overheads administration and advertising an average us major boeing flies stages block hours per day and costs per block hour of ownership of maintenance of fuel and of crew or per seats per block hour for boeing low cost carrier like southwest have lower operating costs at than full service one like united at and higher productivity with asm per day against resulting in unit cost of cts asm against cts asm assets and financing the golden lounge of malaysia airlines at kuala lumpur international airport klia the airline has ownership of special slots at klia giving it competitive edge over other airlines operating at the airport airline financing is quite complex since airlines are highly leveraged operations not only must they purchase or lease new airliner bodies and engines regularly they must make major long term fleet decisions with the goal of meeting the demands of their markets while producing fleet that is relatively economical to operate and maintain comparably southwest airlines and their reliance on single airplane type the boeing and derivatives with the now defunct eastern air lines which operated different aircraft types each with varying pilot engine maintenance and support needs second financial issue is that of hedging oil and fuel purchases which are usually second only to labor in its relative cost to the company however with the current high fuel prices it has become the largest cost to an airline legacy airlines compared with new entrants have been hit harder by rising fuel prices partly due to the running of older less fuel efficient aircraft while hedging instruments can be expensive they can easily pay for themselves many times over in periods of increasing fuel costs such as in the period in view of the congestion apparent at many international airports the ownership of slots at certain airports the right to take off or land an aircraft at particular time of day or night has become significant tradable asset for many airlines clearly take off slots at popular times of the day can be critical in attracting the more profitable business traveler to given airline flight and in establishing competitive advantage against competing airline if particular city has two or more airports market forces will tend to attract the less profitable routes or those on which competition is weakest to the less congested airport where slots are likely to be more available and therefore cheaper for example reagan national airport attracts profitable routes due partly to its congestion leaving less profitable routes to baltimore washington international airport and dulles international airport other factors such as surface transport facilities and onward connections will also affect the relative appeal of different airports and some long distance flights may need to operate from the one with the longest runway for example laguardia airport is the preferred airport for most of manhattan due to its proximity while long distance routes must use john kennedy international airport longer runways airline partnerships home countries of airlines in the largest airline alliances star alliance grey skyteam blue and oneworld purple iata codes of founders are outlined in red japan airlines boeing with special oneworld livery oneworld is the third largest airline alliance after star alliance and skyteam codesharing is the most common type of airline partnership it involves one airline selling tickets for another airline flights under its own airline code an early example of this was japan airlines jal codesharing partnership with aeroflot in the on tokyo moscow flights aeroflot operated the flights using aeroflot aircraft but jal sold tickets for the flights as if they were jal flights this practice allows airlines to expand their operations at least on paper into parts of the world where they cannot afford to establish bases or purchase aircraft another example was the austrian sabena partnership on the vienna brussels new york jfk route during the late using sabena boeing with austrian livery since airline reservation requests are often made by city pair such as show me flights from chicago to düsseldorf an airline that can codeshare with another airline for variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering chicago düsseldorf flight the passenger is advised however that airline no operates the flight from say chicago to amsterdam and airline no operates the continuing flight on different airplane sometimes from another terminal to düsseldorf thus the primary rationale for code sharing is to expand one service offerings in city pair terms to increase sales more recent development is the airline alliance which became prevalent in the late these alliances can act as virtual mergers to get around government restrictions alliances of airlines such as star alliance oneworld and skyteam coordinate their passenger service programs such as lounges and frequent flyer programs offer special interline tickets and often engage in extensive codesharing sometimes systemwide these are increasingly integrated business combinations sometimes including cross equity arrangements in which products service standards schedules and airport facilities are standardized and combined for higher efficiency one of the first airlines to start an alliance with another airline was klm who partnered with northwest airlines both airlines later entered the skyteam alliance after the fusion of klm and air france in often the companies combine it operations or purchase fuel and aircraft as bloc to achieve higher bargaining power however the alliances have been most successful at purchasing invisible supplies and services such as fuel airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors if an airline main domestic competitor flies boeing airliners then the airline may prefer to use airbus aircraft regardless of what the rest of the alliance chooses fuel hedging fuel hedging is contractual tool used by transportation companies like airlines to reduce their exposure to volatile and potentially rising fuel costs several low cost carriers such as southwest airlines adopt this practice southwest is credited with maintaining strong business profits between and the early due to its fuel hedging policy many other airlines are replicating southwest hedging policy to control their fuel costs seasonality airlines often have strong seasonality with traffic low in winter and peaking in summer in europe the most extreme market are the greek islands with july august having more than ten times the winter traffic as jet is the most seasonal among low cost carriers with july having seven times the january traffic whereas legacy carriers are much less with only variability environmental impacts modis tracking of contrails generated by air traffic over the southeastern united states on january aircraft engines emit noise pollution gases and particulate emissions and contribute to global dimming growth of the industry in recent years raised number of ecological questions domestic air transport grew in china at percent annually from to the rate of air travel globally increased at percent per year over the same time in the eu greenhouse gas emissions from aviation increased by between and however it must be compared with the flights increase only in uk between and terminal passengers increased from thousands to thousands according to aea reports every year million passengers travel by european airlines which also share of merchandise value in and out of europe without even pressure from green activists targeting lower ticket prices generally airlines do what is possible to cut the fuel consumption and gas emissions connected therewith further according to some reports it can be concluded that the last piston powered aircraft were as fuel efficient as the average jet in despite continuing efficiency improvements from the major aircraft manufacturers the expanding demand for global air travel has resulted in growing greenhouse gas ghg emissions currently the aviation sector including us domestic and global international travel make approximately percent of global anthropogenic ghg emissions per annum north america accounts for nearly percent of the world ghg emissions from aviation fuel use co emissions from the jet fuel burned per passenger on an average airline flight is about kilograms pounds loss of natural habitat potential associated with the jet fuel burned per passenger on airline flight is estimated to be square meters square feet in the context of climate change and peak oil there is debate about possible taxation of air travel and the inclusion of aviation in an emissions trading scheme with view to ensuring that the total external costs of aviation are taken into account the airline industry is responsible for about percent of greenhouse gases emitted by the transportation sector boeing estimates that biofuels could reduce flight related greenhouse gas emissions by to percent the solution would be blending algae fuels with existing jet fuel boeing and air new zealand are collaborating with leading brazilian biofuel maker tecbio new zealand aquaflow bionomic and other jet biofuel developers around the world virgin atlantic and virgin green fund are looking into the technology as part of biofuel initiative klm has made the first commercial flight with biofuel in there are projects on electric aircraft and some of them are fully operational as of call signs each operator of scheduled or charter flight uses an airline call sign when communicating with airports or air traffic control centres most of these call signs are derived from the airline trade name but for reasons of history marketing or the need to reduce ambiguity in spoken english so that pilots do not mistakenly make navigational decisions based on instructions issued to different aircraft some airlines and air forces use call signs less obviously connected with their trading name for example british airways uses speedbird call sign named after the logo of its predecessor boac while skyeurope used relax airline personnel air bishkek airbus landing at domodedovo airport the various types of airline personnel include flight operations personnel including flight safety personnel flight crew responsible for the operation of the aircraft flight crew members include pilots captain and first officer some older aircraft also required flight engineer and or navigator flight attendants led by purser on larger aircraft in flight security personnel on some airlines most notably el al groundcrew responsible for operations at airports ground crew members include aerospace and avionics engineers responsible for certifying the aircraft for flight and management of aircraft maintenance aerospace engineers responsible for airframe powerplant and electrical systems maintenance malaysia airlines airbus departs london heathrow airport england avionics engineers responsible for avionics and instruments maintenance airframe and powerplant technicians electric system technicians responsible for maintenance of electrical systems philippine airlines airbus taxiing to stand at flight dispatchers baggage handlers ramp agents remote centralised weight and balancing gate agents ticket agents passenger service agents such as airline lounge employees reservation agents usually but not always at facilities outside the airport crew schedulers airlines follow corporate structure where each broad area of operations such as maintenance flight operations including flight safety and passenger service is supervised by vice president larger airlines often appoint vice presidents to oversee each of the airline hubs as well airlines employ lawyers to deal with regulatory procedures and other administrative tasks industry trends map of scheduled airline traffic in the pattern of ownership has been privatized in the recent years that is the ownership has gradually changed from governments to private and individual sectors or organizations this occurs as regulators permit greater freedom and non government ownership in steps that are usually decades apart this pattern is not seen for all airlines in all regions growth rates are not consistent in all regions but countries with de regulated airline industry have more competition and greater pricing freedom this results in lower fares and sometimes dramatic spurts in traffic growth the australia canada japan brazil india and other markets exhibit this trend the industry has been observed to be cyclical in its financial performance four or five years of poor earnings precede five or six years of improvement but profitability even in the good years is generally low in the range of net profit after interest and tax in times of profit airlines lease new generations of airplanes and upgrade services in response to higher demand since the industry has not earned back the cost of capital during the best of times conversely in bad times losses can be dramatically worse warren buffett in said the money that had been made since the dawn of aviation by all of this country airline companies was zero absolutely zero as in many mature industries consolidation is trend airline groupings may consist of limited bilateral partnerships long term multi faceted alliances between carriers equity arrangements mergers or takeovers since governments often restrict ownership and merger between companies in different countries most consolidation

ally mcbeal is an american legal comedy drama television series originally aired on fox from september to may created by david kelley the series stars calista flockhart in the title role as lawyer working in the fictional boston law firm cage and fish with other lawyers whose lives and loves were eccentric humorous and dramatic the series received critical acclaim in its early seasons winning the golden globe award for best television series musical or comedy in and and also winning the emmy award for outstanding comedy series in overview the series set in the fictional boston law firm cage and fish begins with main character allison marie ally mcbeal joining the firm co owned by her law school classmate richard fish played by greg germann after leaving her previous job due to sexual harassment on her first day ally is horrified to find that she will be working alongside her ex boyfriend billy thomas gil bellows whom she has never gotten over to make things worse billy is now married to fellow lawyer georgia courtney thorne smith who also and later joins cage and fish the triangle among the three forms the basis for the main plot for the show first three seasons although ostensibly legal drama the main focus of the series was the romantic and personal lives of the main characters often using legal proceedings as plot devices to contrast or reinforce character drama for example bitter divorce litigation of client might provide backdrop for ally decision to break up with boyfriend legal arguments were also frequently used to explore multiple sides of various social issues cage fish which becomes cage fish mcbeal or cage fish associates towards the end of the series the fictional law firm where most of the characters work is depicted as highly sexualized environment symbolized by its unisex restroom lawyers and secretaries in the firm routinely date flirt with or have romantic history with each other and frequently run into former or potential romantic interests in the courtroom or on the street outside the series had many offbeat and frequently surreal running gags and themes such as ally tendency to immediately fall over whenever she met somebody she found attractive or richard fish wattle fetish and humorous mottos fishisms bygones or john gymnastic dismounts out of the office unisex bathroom stalls or the dancing twins played by eric steve cohen at the bar that ran through the series the show used vivid dramatic fantasy sequences for ally and other characters wishful thinking particularly notable is the dancing baby the series also featured regular visits to local bar where singer vonda shepard regularly performed though occasionally handing over the microphone to the characters the series also took place in the same continuity as david kelley legal drama the practice which aired on abc as the two shows crossed over with one another on occasion very rare occurrence for two shows that aired on different networks

recurring character on the practice has featured guest role in the ally mcbeal episode do you wanna dance most of the primary practice cast members guest starred in the ally mcbeal episode the inmates in storyline that concluded with the practice episode axe murderer featuring calista flockhart and gil bellows reprising their ally characters what unusual about this continuing storyline is that ally mcbeal and the practice aired on different networks bobby donnell the main character of the practice played by dylan mcdermott was featured heavily in both this crossover and another ally mcbeal episode these are the days regular practice cast members lara flynn boyle and michael badalucco each had cameo in ally mcbeal boyle as woman who trades insults with ally in the episode making spirits bright and badalucco as one of ally dates in the episode know him by heart but it is unclear whether they were playing the same characters they play on the practice reception upon premiering in the show was an instant hit averaging around million viewers per episode the show second season saw an increase in ratings and soon became top show averaging around million viewers per episode the show ratings began to decline in the third season but stabilized in the fourth season after robert downey jr joined the regular cast as ally boyfriend larry paul and fresher aesthetic was created by new art director matthew decoste however downey character was written out after the end of the season due to the actor troubles with drug addiction the first two seasons as well as the fourth remain the most critically acclaimed and saw the most awards success at the emmys sag awards and the golden globes in ally mcbeal placed on entertainment weekly new tv classics list ratings season ratings network rank million fox million fox million fox million fox million fox feminist criticism ally mcbeal received some criticism from tv critics and feminists who found the title character annoying and demeaning to women specifically regarding professional women because of her perceived flightiness lack of demonstrated legal knowledge short skirts and emotional instability perhaps the most notorious example of the debate sparked by the show was the june cover story of time magazine which juxtaposed mcbeal with three pioneering feminists susan anthony betty friedan gloria steinem and asked is feminism dead in episode of the second season of the show ally talks to her co worker john cage about dream she had saying you know had dream that they put my face on the cover of time magazine as the face of feminism music ally mcbeal was heavily music oriented show vonda shepard virtually unknown musician at the time was featured continually on the show her song searchin my soul became the show theme song many of the songs shepard performed were established hits with lyrics that paralleled the events of the episode including both sides now hooked on feeling and tell him besides recording background music for the show shepard frequently appeared at the ends of episodes as musician performing at local piano bar frequented by the main characters on rare occasions her character would have conventional dialogue portion of searchin my soul was played at the beginning of each episode but remarkably the song was never played in its entirety several of the characters had musical leitmotif that played when they appeared john cage was you re the first the last my everything ling woo was the wicked witch of the west theme from the wizard of oz and ally mcbeal herself picked tell him when told by psychiatrist that she needed theme due to the popularity of the show and shepard music soundtrack titled songs from ally mcbeal was released in as well as successor soundtrack titled heart and

absolute magnitude is measure of the luminosity of celestial object on logarithmic astronomical magnitude scale an object absolute magnitude is defined to be equal to the apparent magnitude that the object would have if were viewed from distance of exactly parsecs light years with no extinction or dimming of its light due to absorption by interstellar dust particles by hypothetically placing all objects at standard reference distance from the observer their luminosities can be directly compared on magnitude scale as with all astronomical magnitudes the absolute magnitude can be specified for different wavelength ranges corresponding to specified filter bands or passbands for stars commonly quoted absolute magnitude is the absolute visual magnitude which uses the visual band of the spectrum in the ubv photometric system absolute magnitudes are denoted by capital with subscript representing the filter band used for measurement such as mv for absolute magnitude in the band the more luminous an object the smaller the numerical value of its absolute magnitude difference of magnitudes between the absolute magnitudes of two objects corresponds to ratio of in their luminosities and difference of magnitudes in absolute magnitude corresponds to luminosity ratio of for example star of absolute magnitude mv would be times more luminous than star of absolute magnitude mv as measured in the filter band the sun has absolute magnitude mv highly luminous objects can have negative absolute magnitudes for example the milky way galaxy has an absolute magnitude of about an object absolute bolometric magnitude represents its total luminosity over all wavelengths rather than in single filter band as expressed on logarithmic magnitude scale to convert from an absolute magnitude in specific filter band to absolute bolometric magnitude bolometric correction is applied for solar system bodies that shine in reflected light different definition of absolute magnitude is used based on standard reference distance of one astronomical unit stars and galaxies in stellar and galactic astronomy the standard distance is parsecs about light years petameters or trillion kilometres star at parsecs has parallax of milliarcseconds galaxies and other extended objects are much larger than parsecs their light is radiated over an extended patch of sky and their overall brightness cannot be directly observed from relatively short distances but the same convention is used galaxy magnitude is defined by measuring all the light radiated over the entire object treating that integrated brightness as the brightness of single point like or star like source and computing the magnitude of that point like source as it would appear if observed at the standard parsecs distance consequently the absolute magnitude of any object equals the apparent magnitude it would have if it were parsecs away the measurement of absolute magnitude is made with an instrument called bolometer when using an absolute magnitude one must specify the type of electromagnetic radiation being measured when referring to total energy output the proper term is bolometric magnitude the bolometric magnitude usually is computed from the visual magnitude plus bolometric correction this correction is needed because very hot stars radiate mostly ultraviolet radiation whereas very cool stars radiate mostly infrared radiation see planck law some stars visible to the naked eye have such low absolute magnitude that they would appear bright enough to outshine the planets and cast shadows if they were at parsecs from the earth examples include rigel deneb naos and betelgeuse for comparison sirius has an absolute magnitude of which is brighter than the sun whose absolute visual magnitude is it actually serves as reference point the sun absolute bolometric magnitude is set arbitrarily usually at absolute magnitudes of stars generally range from to the absolute magnitudes of galaxies can be much lower brighter for example the giant elliptical galaxy has an absolute magnitude of as bright as about stars of magnitude apparent magnitude the greek astronomer hipparchus established numerical scale to describe the brightness of each star appeared in the sky the brightest stars in the sky were assigned an apparent magnitude and the dimmest stars visible to the naked eye are assigned the difference between them corresponds to factor of in brightness for objects within the milky way the absolute magnitude and apparent magnitude from any distance in parsecs is related by where is the radiant flux measured at distance in parsecs the radiant flux measured at distance the relation can be written in terms of logarithm where the insignificance of extinction by gas and dust is assumed typical extinction rates within the galaxy are to magnitudes per kiloparsec when dark clouds are taken into account for objects at very large distances outside the milky way the luminosity distance must be used instead of in parsecs because the euclidean approximation is invalid for distant objects and general relativity must be taken into account moreover the cosmological redshift complicates the relation between absolute and apparent magnitude because the radiation observed was shifted into the red range of the spectrum to compare the magnitudes of very distant objects with those of local objects correction might have to be applied to the magnitudes of the distant objects the absolute magnitude can also be approximated using apparent magnitude and stellar parallax or using apparent magnitude and distance modulus examples rigel has visual magnitude of and distance about light years vega has parallax of and an apparent magnitude of alpha centauri has parallax of and an apparent magnitude of the black eye galaxy has visual magnitude of and distance modulus of bolometric magnitude the bolometric magnitude takes into account electromagnetic radiation at all wavelengths it includes those unobserved due to instrumental pass band the earth atmospheric absorption and extinction by interstellar dust it is defined based on the luminosity of the stars in the case of stars with few observations it must be computed assuming an effective temperature classically the difference in bolometric magnitude is related to the luminosity ratio according to which makes by inversion where is the sun luminosity bolometric luminosity is the star luminosity bolometric luminosity is the bolometric magnitude of the sun is the bolometric magnitude of the star in august the international astronomical union passed resolution defining the zero points of the absolute and apparent bolometric magnitude scales in si units for power watts and irradiance respectively although bolometric magnitudes had been used by astronomers for many decades there had been systematic differences in the absolute magnitude luminosity scales presented in various astronomical references and no international standardization this led to systematic differences in bolometric corrections scales which when combined with incorrect assumed absolute bolometric magnitudes for the sun could lead to systematic errors in estimated stellar luminosities and stellar properties calculated which rely on stellar luminosity such as radii ages and so on resolution defines an absolute bolometric magnitude scale where corresponds to luminosity with the zero point luminosity set such that the sun with nominal luminosity corresponds to absolute bolometric magnitude placing radiation source star at the standard distance of parsecs it follows that the zero point of the apparent bolometric magnitude scale corresponds to irradiance using the iau scale the nominal total solar irradiance solar constant measured at astronomical unit corresponds to an apparent bolometric magnitude of the sun of following resolution the relation between star absolute bolometric magnitude and its luminosity is no longer directly tied to the sun variable luminosity where is the star luminosity bolometric luminosity in watts is the zero point luminosity is the bolometric magnitude of the star the new iau absolute magnitude scale permanently disconnects the scale from the variable sun however on this si power scale the nominal solar luminosity corresponds closely to value that was commonly adopted by astronomers before the iau resolution the luminosity of the star in watts can be calculated as function of its absolute bolometric magnitude as using the variables as defined previously solar system bodies for planets and asteroids definition of absolute magnitude that is more meaningful for non stellar objects is used in this case the absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude that the object would have if it were one astronomical unit au from both the sun and the observer and in conditions of ideal solar opposition in fact one has to take into account that solar system bodies are illuminated by the sun therefore the magnitude varies as function of illumination conditions described by the phase angle this relationship is referred to as the phase curve the absolute magnitude is defined for the ideal case of phase angle equal to zero to convert stellar or galactic absolute magnitude into planetary one subtract comet nuclear magnitude is different scale and can not be used for size comparison with an asteroid magnitude apparent magnitude diffuse reflection on sphere and flat disk the absolute magnitude can be used to help calculate the apparent magnitude of body under different conditions where is au is the phase angle the angle between the body sun and body observer lines by the law of cosines we have is the phase integral integration of reflected light number in the to range example ideal diffuse reflecting sphere reasonable first approximation for planetary bodies full phase diffuse sphere reflects as much light as diffuse disc of the same diameter distances is the distance between the observer and the body is the distance between the sun and the body is the distance between the observer and the sun note because solar system bodies are never perfect diffuse reflectors astronomers use empirically derived relationships to predict apparent magnitudes when accuracy is required example moon au how bright is the moon from earth full moon actual value full moon reflects more light than perfect diffuse reflector predicts quarter moon if diffuse reflector actual value approximately the diffuse reflector formula does well for smaller phases meteors for meteor the standard distance for measurement of magnitudes is at an altitude of at the observer zenith see also photographic magnitude hertzsprung russell
